# Kubeflow for Machine Learning

A repository with all learning materials I cover on the 
long way to learn Kubeflow for Machine Learning. 

It contains: 

- [base](Kubeflow/base): The entry-point repo (component, pipelines, volumes...)
- [ml-components](Kubeflow/ml-components): Step by step through ML pipeline components
- [ml-demos](Kubeflow/ml-demos): The collection of end-to-end demos
