1066,"I tried these on in the store, and they are super cute but run small. i typically wear a size 25 (i'm 5' 5"" and 108 lbs.) and they were too tight for me. i like the fabric and the cut; i think they'd be great one size up. (my store didn't have them.)",1
1055,"I took the advise of a reviewer and sized down to xs. i am 5'6 and 110. i could take them off without unbuttoning them, they were hugh, even the xs! they looked like a halloween costume. even at the discounted sale price, awful and kind of made me laugh. but i guess that's why they are still available at this sale price.",0
1066,"I ordered these in my usual pilcro petite size 6. they were impossible to button, which is interesting 'cause i also ordered the pilcro wide leg chinos in the same size and they fit perfectly, as usual. but it ended up being ok because i don't care for the speckled, slightly rough material or the contrasting piping. back they go!",0
863,"Great top! i'm 5'7"", 135lbs and normally wear either an xs or s. i ordered the white to start with and decided to go back for the other 2 colors. it's a great basic to wear with pants/shorts/skirts, but the side slit and slant set it apart from a regular tank. i opted for the small in this top just because of where the side slit hit.",1
872,"I have more of an athletic figure, and the sleeves tend to come in closer to the body than pictured. i didn't like that cut on my arms/torso. the shirt is really cute, otherwise! i am usually a size 4/small and this was a little short and snug.",0
917,"I love the tie-dye look! i ordered the blue color in my usual size small. fit is tts. love it!. just a fyi: 1. on mine, one arm is a darker blue tie-dye, the other is very light (color variation). 2. the white band on the mock-neck doesn't give much, so be careful when putting on/taking off.  i think it's pricey, but ordered during the promo so that made it better. it came yesterday, put it on w/ my washed blue skinny jeans, out to dinner we went!",1
1079,"Strange fit if you have a short torso. i ordered a medium petite and the drop waist looked strange, so i tried using a belt and it bunched up. returned the dress. why should a nice simple dress like this create such hard work?!",1
1025,"The fabric is absolutely lovely on these, but very thin. the top part was tighter than usual (and i sized up from my regular pilcro jean size) and they flare a lot. so the thin, tight top was not a flattering look. the rise also felt short. 

i'm 5' 4"" with a 30"" inseam and the regular length just hovered above my ankles. my husband burst out laughing when i tried them on, which is never a good reaction!  even if i hemmed them, i think these are a miss for me. will be returning.

641,Ordered this cover up in a mp but it was waaay too big so now waiting for the sp to arrive! hope its a hit!,1
1095,On a hot summer 90 degree day the blue ink on the dress stained the dress and my new tory burch bag. i would never have expected that the blue print would bleed all over me and my new dress. great dress and such a wonderful fit...too bad its unwearable now.,0
1044,"I see all the amazing reviews and on one hand, i agree with them. but these pants do run huge and they don't fit tailored like on the model. on me, they fit loose around the legs and thighs and they're super wrinkly. you'll have to iron these after every wear and every wash. i'm surprised to see the comment saying they're wrinkle resistant. they aren't. also, the kahki is more grey which i don't love. i got these on sale, but even at $50 i just can't justify keeping them. they're super comfy but",0
833,"Thought i'd love this top; i'm a sucker for lace anything from retailer.  but i found the lace, while pretty, to be quite rough, which to me indicates a lower quality. and i guess i should've known that it would be very swingy (photos show that) but it really overwhelmed me.  for reference, 5'5"", 125 lbs, 34d. sad, but this went back.",0
862,"I always have to try on tops of retailer. i know this, and yet i ordered a top through the website anyway. i don't think i'll do it again. the drape of the top seen in the pictures did not translate in real life because the top scratched up pretty quickly. ironically, when i washed it (according to directions) it also shrunk quite a bit.",0
895,"I was worried about this item when i ordered it because of how it looks in the picture, but i had wishful thinking. i should have gone with my gut! this shirt does not have the same quality as all my other retailer purchases. it is see-through and flimsy. the bottom is just like the picture, it hangs in an odd rumpled way. the top is very flattering though, so it's a shame! if the bottom fit nicer like their other products i could have gotten away with wearing a cami under it to make up for the qu",0
1099,"This is a cute dress, but it runs very large through. if i had decided to keep it, i would have taken it to my seamstress to remove some of the volume. when i ordered, i assumed it was red and black checked, but it is navy. my black cropped leather jacket and boots won't work with those colors, so it is going back.",1
1033,These jeans fit well and the stretch makes them comfortable. i can't recommemd them though because they're see through. wish white jeans were better lined so that this isn't usually a problem!,0
1092,"I sized down as other reviewers suggested (usually an 8, went down to 6) and the dress fit fine--but it was not attractive. the cut was like a tent with an empire waist. really just not attractive. maybe it has to do with my body type, but compared to the model, this dress was so unflattering in-person. returned.",0
403,"The color and pattern are so cute and fun. they are also very soft and comfortable. most important, these pants still keep everything covered when i bend into a forward fold.",1
1075,"This dress looks very beautiful on the model shown. unfortunately, when i tried it on, it did not flow as nicely as i would have liked it to. i also didn't care much for the waist ties on the side. an elastic waist might have been better.",0
273,I wouldn't be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75% less. they are so cheaply constructed. one wash and they're all but guaranteed to shrink. the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer. they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them.,0
509,"These are very pretty, but i have had a few problems with them. out of the package, i found them to be true to size. i think i purchased the pxxs or the pxs. however, even though they are machine washable, i feel that they shrunk upon washing and are now too short (i am barely over 5' tall). also, the elastic waistband keeps twisting within the casing, which drives me crazy. i have to keep straightening it. i think there are better options for sleep pants.",0
167,"I bought these on a whim on mother's day when i was out shopping. i didn't try even try them on at the store. i got them home and couldn't believe how great they fit and how comfortable they were. the length is perfect for me. not too long or too short. they did stretch out a bit upon wearing them but i like the comfortable, relaxed look. i washed and dried them in the dryer. they came out perfect. i bought the coral color. will be buying more as it is hard to find shorts that work for me. i rec",1
1030,"Love these vintage soft jeans.. they do run small so be sure get a size larger.. i am typically a 27 and i ordered a 28... look amazing with boots, flip flops and slip ons... love mother jeans.. work every time",1
830,"I ordered a small, which is my usual retailer size, but this was like a tent on me. it's fine if you like things super super blousey but that wasn't what i was looking for. also it is very long, a very weird amount of long. also there is only eyelet on the front. the whole back of the shirt is just plain fabric. i like the idea of this shirt but all in all it was very disappointing.",0
829,"Based on reviews, i got the medium pink size: 8 petite because some said it was tight in the bust area and pulled at the buttons creating a gap. i'm 5'6"" and 32d. i figured the 8 petite would be big enough in the bust area and the petite would be shorter. it was too big and even though it was petite, still too long. wanted to like it, but at full price, decided to return.",1
1081,"I was really excited about this dress. i had only seen it online and it looked like the perfect transitional piece, casual or dress up. when it arrived in the mail, the feel of the fabric was great and i slipped it on and it was so comfy i felt like i was wearing a nightdress. unfortunately it hung like that, too. the material sags in places it shouldn't. i have a 5'8"" 125 lb frame, and i ordered an extra small, and both my husband and sister said it was unflattering and urged me to send it back",0
895,This shirt is wonderful! i totally recommend it for everyone.,1
878,Wore for the 4th with white jeans super cute love the ruffle,1
1056,My favorite pants! they do run slightly large so i sized down. i have 3 colors and will continue to add more!,1
877,"This top is really cute online, but that's about it.  it runs large, but even if i sized down the ruffles were a bit much and the top was a little boxy surprisingly.",0
1072,I was very surprised to see such dark blue sequence on this dress. it did not appear as it did on the photo. i was pretty disappointed by the color. the photo of the dress is much more impressive.,0
1103,Nice work dress. flirty style for spring.,1
1083,I received so many compliments on this dress. i purchased my usual size 12 and it fit fine. i agree with some other reviewers that i could have probably gone a size down for a more snug fit.,1
862,"I bought this in the white, size m (140lbs., 5'8"", 34b) because i wanted a baggy fit, which i got, so this is tts. the white is more of an off-white rather than a bright white, which i like because i happen to be looking for an off-white tee. and the shape is good--even in a larger size, this tee nips in at the waist.however, the quality of this tee is lacking, as it is the typical, cheap, marled, slightly see-through material that seems to be everywhere these days and the band on the back of th",0
850,"I read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me, but it did not. i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big. it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame. overall, it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else! if you're tall and slender, i think this top would work!",0
1081,"I bought this dress when i saw it go on sale, and i am glad i did! love how it fits the length everything about it. it is true to size and it looks very flattering, i will be wearing it for my anniversary date with my husband. highly recommend! i am 130 lbs, 34d, and the size 6 fit perfectly!",1
975,"Ahh it's delightful! it's a little short in the fit, but it's so cute. and didn't cost an absurd amount like some more heavy weight or full trench coats. love it.",1
1059,"Got charlie trousers last year in a different print in my usual size 4 (5'2"", 115#). they initially fit perfectly but stretched out in the thighs and waist and now are loose.  this time i bought a size smaller (size 2). they were snug but i felt them stretch during the first wear and they fit fine now.  i recommend sizing down because they stretch out. love the print for summer (i love anything beachy) and had to have it!  nice comfortable material which isn't hot for summer.  got the regular si",1
866,"I like that you can dress this shirt up or down. go out, or lounge in it! very comfortable and i would recommend buying it.",1
877,"I found this in store last weekend and thought it was it perfect. i got the size small which had plenty of space for me, usually a 4-6 or small (34a-28-26).
it's long, i found it to be just below knee length (5'6"").
if you zoom in, you can see some detail work along the front edges which complements the pretty openwork in back.
it has pockets too btw :)
this will be worn over everything this summer, let's hope the poly/rayon/spandex blend washes ok!",1
1094,"This dress fits perfect! the material is so soft and hangs so flattering. long enough to cover the booty, but short enough to show off my legs. and the color is beautiful (i got the wine color).",1
881,"Looks beautiful in the photo and the color in person is beautiful but it runs so so large that i think even an extra small would be too large for me. just for comparison, and i wish all reviewers would include this, i am 5'5"" and weigh 120 pounds. i ordered a medium which a small to medium is my usual size but i ordered the medium because i wanted to have room to wear something under it. i could have worn two sweatshirts under this sweater. unfortunately i have returned it.",0
975,"I wore this blazer for one day, didn't do anything strenuous, and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back, next to the center seam. it's completely unfixable, since it's not the seam that split but the fabric itself. what a waste of money.

as to the fit, it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it, so it's good over something cute.

or, it would be, if it didn't fall apart.",0
1068,"Bummed out.. this is super cheaply made and very expensive... the design is different , the color is beautiful, but the material is a different story.. it should be priced at the most 30 bucks.. not 128.. i'm returning them. also, they run very big..!",0
875,"This top is fun to wear & looks great with black, grey or my wine color jeans!! love it!",1
825,"If you have anything larger than an a cup, this shirt will likely not fit right. it is very pretty but the seem on the front runs directly in the middle of the chest. it literally runs right through the center of the breasts. what were they thinking? if it had been three inches higher or lower, it would have been perfect. for reference, i'm approximately 105lb and have a dd cup.",0
862,"I purchased this top in the black and tan color, loved the fit, style and fabric. however, it is a loose weave and after just one wearing a hole opened up on the front, which could not be repaired. it was covered by the cowl neck collar but as the day wore on the hole got bagger and it can no longer be hidden. i was very disappointed in the quality of this top- i purchased it at full price and was only able to wear it once. i just didn't have the time to return it to the store.",0
1081,"It was quite a bit shorter on me than what it shows on the model who is the same height. the pull-on styling is a #fail as i could barely get my head through the neck opening! i was afraid it might rip a seam. the fabric seems low quality, like it would stretch out and degrade faster than others. overall, not the dress or quality i expected :/",0
974,"This is the tiniest blazer i've ever purchased in a size 10. i usually wear an 8, but sized up based on other reviews and it was still too small. it's very attractive but please size true to size",0
873,"Love this top. makes me look slimmer, comfortable as well",1
1094,"This jumpsuit is so cute and it looked amazing on. i had to return it because of the poor design. it was extremely hard to put on and take off! there are so many buttons to do and undo which are not as easy as snaps! the fabric buttons definitely make a great look to the jumpsuit but there should be a zipper on the side for easy access, or use snaps instead of the loops for the fabric buttons. what a shame of a lovely and classy design on a good quality material, but not worth it if it's difficu",0
1083,"I generally wear a size 6, and am 5 ft 3 in in height. the size 6 fell below the knees and did not look right. the fit of the 6 petite is beautiful and flattering. the dress is indeed lovely, and i really want to love this dress as much as others do... however, i am conflicted. i am modest in my style, and even though nothing is revealed, the strategic placement of lace panels makes it a bit suggestive, and takes it out of my comfort zone.",1
850,"This blouse was just right for me. 5'3' and in my late fifties. not too frilly so still age appropriate yet feminine and fun. i have largish arms from working out and the sleeves fit with give. and at this stage of life, the boxy look that falls just below the waist is flattering. i took a 10 regular (i'm usually a medium r or m-petite) and the fit was comfortable and right. both colors are unusual and it works nicely with pants and skirts.",1
1083,"I am obsessed with this dress. i wore it on new year's eve. i felt stunning in it. i can't wait to wear it again as soon as possible.
very good quality. my regular size 6 fit me but i cannot gain not even a pound more :) i'm 5""7' 144lb. i'm between slender and curvy.",1
867,"I had such high hopes for this top! the colors! the peplum! the ruffles! the price point! the fit was terrible, unflattering, and laughable! please try again with this one, retailer. you could have a real winner with a little tweaking!",0
1082,"The design/shape of the dress are quite flattering, flirty and feminine. but.... there is no way that the dress i received is new. the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area. there is no tag... the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp, stiff or new. i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received. undoubtedly this one is going back.

dear retailer - please make sure that you do not send pre-owend clothing articles to",0
1048,"These culottes are fun. i bought the neutral color with the black stripes in xs. in my opinion, they run big. i am usually a small (4-6), 31"" waist, 38"" hips. pleats at the hip and low waist area are not always my friend, but with a longer tank or shirt, they looked fine. the fabric moves in a graceful way and these culottes can be dressed up or down. so far, wrinkling isn't a huge problem but we'll see. i am 5' 9"" tall and these fall about the same place on the model--mid calf. they looked grea",1
1079,"The fabric was a beautiful color, but the material and seams were not well put together. the elastic in the arm was stretched before i tried on the dress so the sleeves did not fit well. i unfortunately ended up returning.",0
1111,This dress is amazing. it is comfortable with great fabric and very high quality. if you have a lot of curves it may not be the best dress as it has no give and flows straight down from the shoulder.,1
1137,"It is seldom that i write a review about a tee, but after receiving the jessa tee in the mail today, i just felt compelled to do so! the deal is, this tee is pricey for sure, but in my opinion, it is worth it! as another reviewer said, the cotton fabric is hefty; in fact, it could also be called a ""lightweight sweater."" everything about this tee is perfect and classic: the elbow sleeves, the nice neckline, and the semi-boxy, semi-cropped fit. it will go with everything from jeans, to nice slacks",1
717,"Love these! i am a medium in shorts or 29-30, and the medium fit perfectly.. true to size, very soft, flattering cut and color. love the embroidery. great for travel, very light and can be jazzed up a little with nice sandals, almost like a flirty little short skirt. the fullness and non fitted look is great for a less than perfect tummy.
i am very happy with this purchase.",1
899,"This is really cute but does run large, if your in between sizes size down. the fabric at the front is super bulky but with a smaller size could be ok? it is so itchy, imo uncomfotably so! i would have returned for a smaller size had it not been so uncomfortable, ugh why! i loved the sleeves, very cute bell. and the back hung nicely. they need to make this in a cotton, vocoder and no wool! loved bit couldnt bear it.",0
895,"The sleeves on this top always caught my eye every single time i was in a store. they never had my size to try on, so when a free shipping offer came up, i ordered the ivory top in a size large. well, the sleeves are indeed stunning, but that is all that is attractive about this top! the rest was a plain, blank, white canvas. in fact, that's what it felt like to wear it -- like i was wearing a tent or an artist's canvas on my chest. yuck! how can this designer put so much thought and care into t",0
868,This would have been cute if it was more fitted. i am 5'7 and 125 lbs and the small was too wide. i didn't try the xs because the small was almost too short in the sleeves and so was the length.,0
938,"I wanted to roder hte petite version, as it runs long, but they are out of the ivory. i put hte green-ish color in my basket, and may order it, but for now, i am hlding off as i have other nice seaters... so many choices.

long, warm, fun closure, falttering, and nice tie back detail.",1
1142,Flattering fitted form. flowing fabric. well made. colors are true to pictures.,1
867,"I hate to be so negative but i can't believe this shirt has so many positive reviews. it is stiff, silver lace and hangs funny if you have a chest. adding a cami undnerneath makes it worse. looks cheap.",0
952,This is the perfect duster! transitions you perfectly from summer to fall without being an overly heavy piece. simple and classic! i know i will get a lot of wear out of this item!,1
850,"I loved this top in the blue and wanted so badly for it to fit however it was very unflattering on my 5'7"" frame. the bottom hemline is straight across all around whereas i thought it was longer in the back. i could see this looking great on a really petite frame. runs large, xs fit however wasn't flattering",0
854,"The pattern and colors are very pretty, and the material is soft and silky. i returned it, though, because it is very low-cut in the front. it comes down to between my breasts, which is not going to work for me.",0
1037,"The design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect. however, the fabric, despite 2% spandex, has absolutely no give from the knee down. the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch. while i was able to pull them on (size 27 for 110 lb/5.4'), i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably. with longer wear, i think they would cut off the circulation.

please post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer.",0
993,"I had been waiting for this skirt to go on sale as i fell in love with the style and print on the website. however, after receiving it in the mail i was disappointed to find that the cut was all wrong for my body type. i am 5'6"", size 4, hourglass/athletic. the xs was too big and made me look like i had no shape. would be cute on a girl with no hips/booty but unflattering on hourglass figure.",0
1053,"I wished these fit a little better. unfortunately, they were a little tight in the thighs and if i didn't pull the waist of the pants up, i had sagging crotch and the pockets hung out. needless to say i made a return.",0
168,"I tried this top on today because i was really hoping i could get the shorts and robe set. the shirt was softer than i was expecting, but when i tried it on it was an uncomfortable fit. there was some tightness in the armpit area, which is not where i would have expected it to be tight. the rest of it was comfortable and reasonable looseness so i don't think a size up would have been a good option for me. i like the design a lot so i was really disappointed it didn't fit. it is between a lightwe",0
1121,"Saw this on the retailer emails as a cover and knew i had to try it on. went into the store following day and tried it. to my delight the tencel fabric is light enough for southern california weather and can be worn as a trench coat over skinny jeans, leggings or dresses or act as a dress in itself! love the navy color as it is has more of a washed looked and not too bold. what attracted me to this piece in the first place was the ruffled bottom and the rounded flaps on the back that is different",1
1089,"I saw this dress in our store and immediately walked over to check it out. it is quite a stunning piece. i purchased it without trying it on and wished i would have. unfortunately, there is entirely too much material in the bodice. it was overwhelming on me. for reference i am 5 ""3 and i do wear an xs but i am muscular and not thin. i think it would work well on somebody taller or leggier who could balance out the amount of material in the dress.",0
933,"I saw this in the store and fell in love with it, i didn't buy it at first but i couldn't stop thinking about how comfortable it was so i went back and purchased it, its soft and very comfortable, im glad i went back for it.",1
996,"First, i was surprised that this skirt fabric felt similar to men's tie.  it is a thick weight silky feel.  next, i was surprised by the cut.... i wear a 12/14 petite, and the waist of the large is at least a size 10 if not smaller.  finally, the length was really long.  i realize i am 5'2 and buying non-petite sizes, but the cut was high ankle on me. i like the pattern and ruffles of fabric, both are unusual and good for fall/winter.  but i did not like the rest.",0
876,"I definitely would recommend this top. when i put it on i felt it was true to size, and fit me very well. sometimes my retailer tops tend to be a little roomy, but not in this case. the fit was very nice and its embroidery details make it a special look that i can throw on with my jeans and still look put together. i know this will be a top i wear often.",1
1082,The dress is too loose and runs too big,0
1083,"I got this in a l, and probably i am a m. however, the waist pretty much fit, but the bodice was baggy in a really bizarre way. i don't think a human could actually be shaped a way that would fit properly in this dress. this dress is well suited for a woman with a very large bust, but a small waist.",0
916,"When this poncho first came online i ordered it in the xs/s, my usual size. i was a little disappointed that the point in the front oddly hung low & was off-center. the back was centered. i returned it. when i spotted them at the store recently, i tried on a few in the xs/s to compare & see how others hung. i found that one of them hung fine in the front (centered), the back was a little off center which was fine. it's soft & comfy, love the soft white color & border trim. it's just perfect!",1
1086,"Got the small petite. length is perfect, love the color, super comfy, very pretty. the problem is that you cannot wear a bra because under the armpits is so low that either shows your bra (a lot) or if u wear sans bra you may show your breasts (it's loose all around on top, so very easy to show everything. if i adjust the straps it works but then the waist goes up and it looks like i have a belly. i'm taking to a seamstress to see if she can take in under armpits, if not it's going back. i'm 5',",0
438,"I was so excited for this romper, but was disappointed after trying it on. the material felt cheap for the price, and it runs quite small. will be returning. :(",0
520,"I love the wide straps but it runs small and is short. still great for layering. great, soft material. i hate that it is so tight and short but if i size up them the arm holes would be way too big.",0
986,"Read the reviews and thought i would just remove the label asap to prevent snags since i loved the item! 
however, the item came with unrepairable holes, not just snags and they are either on the neck or front sleeve which forces me to return the item asap. didn't even try it on. so sad, but i still love retailer!!!",0
829,"This top looks adorable in the product photos, so i had high hopes. i think i might be too short to pull it off, but like another reviewer said, i found it to be like a tent on me, billowing out in all directions. it was just overall too big on me--i even considered whether i could wear it as a dress, but the sleeves were also too billowy on me. i am 5'4"", 120 lbs and tried the xs.",0
820,Beautiful summer top and so versatile! it's definitely worth it.,1
1110,"Awful color, horribly wrinkled and just a mess...so disappointed",0
900,I wore this with a velvet moss-colored skirt (also sold at retailer) that hits above knee and received so many compliments. the neckline and sleeves are gorgeous. i like my sweaters comfy so i ordered a medium and love it. not quite cropped but it does hit a bit higher on the waist. sleeves hit above wrist as well.,1
481,"This romper is cute, well-made and true to size, but i haven't figured it out how to put this on without having someone tie the back ties. which pretty much means that going to the bathroom is not an option while you have this romper on. not sure what the designers were thinking here. i'm returning this one.",0
942,"Beautiful 100% lambswool sweater with all these gorgeous fall colors arranged into an eye catching design. i agree with reviewer numero uno, she is correct on all counts: pretty colors, quality construction, ultra long bell sleeves (look at model wearing cedar/neutral colorway), oversized fit. sizing down will still have those ridiculously long sleeves but i'm fine with that. i ordered size m and will exchange for a s as the cardigan is too large overall. wool is soft and just a bit itchy which",1
897,I loved the contrasting design of this sweater. i loved it even more when it arrived. its soft and true to size. i received so many compliments which sealed the deal.,1
936,"This sweater is a great, oversized, warm, and very soft cozy winter treasure. it is very comfortable to wear, and looks cute on. i really believe it would be flattering on almost anyone. i highly recommend it, especially now that it is on sale.",1
896,"I am totally in love with this sweater!! it is lightweight, comfortable, and very versatile. throw on a pair of jeans and it is casual. throw on dark slacks or a skirt and it is dressy. the design does not become the focus of the sweater but rather takes it up a notch making it a fun piece to wear. the color is not a light red, but rather a rich cabernet wine color. this sweater is well on its way to becoming one of my all time favorites!!",1
1083,"The lower part of dress bunches where buttons are, so the dress doesn't look flushed from top to bottom. i ended up returning it.",0
253,"This top exceeded my expectations. i got it in the gray striped pattern, size small. it's probably the combination of the pattern and the removable padding that makes it very flattering on my small chested figure (i would imagine big chested gals would not find enough support in this one though). the fabric is very soft and comfortable with just enough stretch. overall, very happy with this top. but does it have to be so expensive, retailer?",1

835,Gosh this is beautiful but it is way wider and puffer than i imagined it would be. in fact it almost looks like a costume or something you would buy handmade. i would just feel silly wearing this out to dinner with a group of friends. i gave it high ratings on the quality however because it really is beautiful but the design is just not what i had hoped for.,0

839,"Beautiful in white, and beautiful to look at, but as the other reviewer mentioned, the fabric is very sheer and see thru. not a deal breaker if worn over a cami; however, the reason i am returning it is the fit. there is too much fabric flaring right at my waist. it looks like a tent on me. in addition, some of the beading is already coming off, and i can't imagine what it will look like after one wash. that's too bad, but i can't justify paying this much money for a sweet top that is beautiful",0

1089,I love this dress because it is everything i have been looking for. it is flattering because of the details and it gives the illusion of an hourglass figure if you don't have one. i love that it has sleeves because sometimes i just don't feel like finding a shawl or bolero or whatever in case i get suddenly anxious about my arms. the green is dark and shimmering almost like lace over jewel tone emerald. love.,1

834,"I so wanted to love this top. i ordered the ""blue"", which is blue and orange. i thought the orange would be brighter, it is not. it is a dull color. also, i'm usually a medium, this top fits fine on my shoulders/bust 34c, but it was huge around the waist, making me look a lot larger. if this top were a bit smaller around the waist, i would keep it, but it is going back.",0

829,"I did not like this top at all-but had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have. it is polyester-i thought it was cotton so there's the first reason i didn't like it. secondly, there is a piece of fabric behind the laces, presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat. it wrinkles up behind the lacing, making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top. it is too long for me, the top hitting at top of thigh.

i had been drooling over this top for awhile and was so disappointed! please fix it and then i will buy again. i am 5'4"", 140lbs and busty...a small was perfect, with the exception of the massive amount of material.",0

1083,"I think this dress is beautiful. i ordered it for my brother's wedding, but the nude slip underneath made the dress look a bit too revealing. i may keep it for a holiday party though because it really is gorgeous and super flattering. it dies run large. typically i'm a 10 and the 8 fit perfectly.",1
844,Gorgeous in every way except its length and how it hangs at the bottom. i prefer a shirt i can wear tucked in or out. this one will work well tucked in but not out so i am returning disappointed it was so well done in other particulars.,0

879,"I wasn't sure what to expect when i ordered this but when it arrived i was pleasantly surprised that it's by postmark and has an interesting cut. i ordered the xl in the hope that it would be oversized and slouchy. it is that and more! the lightweight, sweater like material is truly perfect for the transition to spring. i look forward to wearing it tomorrow!",1
1092,Should've ordered a larger size. it runs a bit tight around the top and the zipper isn't that helpful.,1
1098,I tried this on in the store and it was huge. i couldn't try on a smaller size because they only had a 2 and 4. i tried on my usual size 12. i don't think the embroidery is as pretty in person either. definitely not worth the price.,0
862,"I bought this top in two colors--i think it's a really cute, easy top to wear, but the fabric is extremely thin and poor quality. i tucked the front into a pair of shorts and i can already see a small snag forming, which i'm sure will be a hole in no time. two stars only because i really do like the look of the top generally, i just wish it was something that was going to last beyond a couple of wears.",0
1110,"I took everyone's advice and purchased a size small instead if medium.  i wish i had gotten my usual size as the neckline and bodice is very tight.  i'm top heavy with a wide rib cage and 36dd's.   other than that, the skirt of this mango hued beauty is large loose and flowing which i can see why people suggest sizing down.  i think my fit problem would be solved if petite was available.",1

895,I love this poncho. i would wear it to the beach or even for fun outing like wine tasting!,1

114,"The material is super soft and i could see how this could be a great fall sweater, but the furry portion made the top too bulky. i should've sized down, but even then i think it still would've been a touch boxy. if it was boxy all the way through it'd be fine, but it feels like just the top was bulky while the bottom half was fine. perhaps good for more broad shouldered people. i have very small shoulders. also reminded me too much of a sheepskin rug.",0
1022,"The fit on these is good for my hourglass shape, and the fabric quality and comfort is good too.i think the rinse is just not as nice in person- the orange stitching is pretty bright too. i bought. a pair from br a couple months ago that are almost identical in quality, fit and color that i got for less than half the price of these. i am going to return these and see if they have something better , but will only buy in store from now on.",0
862,"Beautiful tee and cut with a classic, simple silhouette. nice weight and true to size. i'm 5'7"", 132# and the small fits me like i like. not tight at all, with room to allow for shrinkage. i really appreciate the higher cut of the neck as most tees i have purchased last several years i love for the overall fit and material but am a little self-conscious in due to the low cut neck. maybe if i weren't as small chested this wouldn't be an issue for me. i definitely recommend this tee.",1
1034,This is one of my favorite pair of pants. they don't stretch out while wearing and wash well. no pilling or shrinking. they can either be worn like leggings or pants. i wear a size 2 pants but got these in a 27 because i don't like them super fitted.,1
1110,"Saw this in the store in pink....very cool dress but i want black so i'm ordering it. the fabric was almost lace-like & it comes w a slip. it was sort of swingy, and designed to be a-line. loved it. the bell sleeves totally make it.",1
1081,Love the tegan tunic version of this dress. i assumed since it looked identical except for the length that the sizing was the same but i was wrong. this runs so big! i got a s in the tegan but the s in this dress looked like an oversized potato sack on. i highly recommend ordering at least 2 sizes down unless you want to look tent-y.,0
933,"Overall i like this sweater, but it does have a couple flaws. the sweater looks better snapped. unfortunately it only has one snap on the front--there should be another one inside. after a couple wears, my snap started to come loose, probably because it pulls so much. the sweater is a bit oversized and i probably ordered the wrong size. i'm 5'7"" and 140 lbs. i ordered a medium, should have ordered a small. all that being said, i still love the look and color (moss green) of the sweater and would",1

1072,"I purchased the green dress in medium. i usually wear a medium. the fabric is pretty. shoulders fit nicely. sleeves were short in an odd length, but that is indeed pictured accurately. the body of the dress is very shapeless, billowy and wide, which made this appear far more like a nightgown than the photo shown. i considered altering the garment, by sewing in the sides from the armpit downward, but i decided to return the dress.",0
965,"I had such high hopes for this jacket based on the photo, i even waited for it to come back in stock. the detail is beautiful but it is shapeless and boxy. for reference i ordered xs, and i am usually a 0/2 on top (small chested). it might look better on someone with a larger chest but looked like a sack on me. so disappointing.",0
1095,"I have wanted this dress since i first tried it on in april. finally got it as a birthday gift and after looking at it closely there was makeup on the collar. i checked the instructions and it says ""cold water wash"". so i washed only the collar part by hand and every part that got water on it bled!!! looks like the popsicles are melting! i'm so sad because this dress is adorable! i'm buying another in hopes retailer will make this right by taking back the first one. should be dry clean only!",0

strangely enough, my only criticism for this is that the outer shell seems to get largish w",1
907,This sweater is quite lovely. the yarn is light and delicate and the sweater is over all very feminine and figure flattering. i bought the light red color which is quite attractive and i'm not usually a fan of reds and pinks. this sweater can be worn casually with jeans or more dressed up for the office. anyone that is looking for a sweater that can be worn with almost anything should defiantly consider this one.,1
860,"A fun top!
i tried on both the medium and large (i'm between sizes, 5'4"", 34g) and preferred the large. the medium waist rode up a bit on my torso, so the large stayed down a bit. also, the medium pleats did not fall as nicely on my chest.",1

872,The uniqueness of this top caught my eye online. i normally wld not want a long sleeve top in the summer. a bit warm to wear outside now but i like the casual but unique style of it. it's a top i can wear now but only indoors with a/c. the regular small fits fine. a little oversized & sleeves a little long - as in the pic. the color/style/detaling is exactly as in the pic - no surprises. soft & comfy. a little opaque but a nude bra will work fine. i don't see the need for a tank/cami under it. i,1
872,I really love this shirt - fits just like the picture shows and runs tts. the color is a beautiful red - a bitter richer/darker in person than it looks online.,1

1151,"Beautiful dress! love the colors and fit. can be dressed up or down. the only negative is that the buttons fall off. this is my third dress and it too lost a button the first time i wore it. i don't live near an retailer store so i will be keeping it anyways, as this is already my third dress :( my advice would be to reinforce the three buttons as soon as you buy it. there is one at the top, front of the dress and one on each sleeve.",1

868,Do not buy! i used my 15% discount on this. what a waste. my usual sizes range from s to l depending on what brand. i should have gotten a small. i don't think that would've helped. it was so awkward looking. nothing like the model. it made me look as if i had gained 15 pounds. it was waaay longer in the back-like a mullet. the material was really thick. it is more appropriate for fall. i had high hopes for this-to dress up or down. it was just so ridiculous.,0

897,I couldn't even figure out how to wear this sweater the fit was so odd. the arms cut off short and the seams don't hit your shoulders where they should. all the extra fabric around the collar is just confusing and unflattering. moving around in it was not easy. i will return this one!,0

895,"This is a very substantial, warm sweater that is so classy and super soft and just different enough. really great with neutral sweater leggings or jeans with boots. you have to wear a longer tank or tee underneath as it it split on the sides but the belt cinches the whole sweater in.",1
1104,"This dress is incredible. i saw a sales girl wearing it in my local retailer and loved it! i bought it in the navy color, it's gorgeous in person, very bright, vibrant colors. i am 5'9 34 c bra 27 inch waist and the s was quite big on my waist. i kept it anyway because the xs has been sold out, and got it taken in a bit. i wore it while vacationing in mexico and it definitely turned heads, if you're thinking about buying this dress, do it, you won't regret it!",1
836,"I love this top and was so happy when it came out in black! i'm typically an 8 on top and sized up to a 10, and it still feels slightly small across the shoulders and arms. it also requires a under tank because it's very sheer, even with the lining. worth it though!",1
1070,"I got these in the brown and the red in my usual xspetite, and love both. the length is perfect for my 5'3"" height and they're not skin tight, but fit like a glove (i have a 26"" waist and 34"" hips). the elastic inside the waistband can get flipped fairly easily if i'm not careful, but it's easy to flip it back. i think that's the only thing that might stop me from attempting to wash them in the machine against the instructions, which say to hand wash only. i wish they had been made machine washa",1

883,This is a cute top but i wore it for around 5 hours and lo and behold i had smurf skin. i did not sweat in it but the color transferred to my underarm area and bra and it did not come off in the shower!! i guess it's going to have to wear off. thank goodness it was not a hot day!! i hope that i can return it.,0
1081,Such a beautiful dress with my favorite print! it does run a size small if you ask me. the size 10 i got fits more like an 8. the corduroy belt really sets the waist off.,1

colors: can't tell from the picture, but there is red and pink thread as part of the tweed, very fun and happy, yet appropriate colors for fall and winter. the cut is very flattering, the scallop part is interesting though, it is sown at one part of the skirt, in the middle, not sure why. i ordered the 0p, and that fit me like a glove.

836,"I saw this in the store and grabbed it to try on due to the material and the back. i was surprised how nice it felt on and how the back looked. i had a blue bra on and it really could not be seen which was a worry. i loved how the back lay and that it was shorter in the front. even for the sale price it was expensive, but i went home with it!! it will go great with long skirts, jeans, and any color pants. i was very happy to walk out of the store with it. i am 5'4"" and about 120. i have a slende",1

829,This blouse is so cute...casual but still stylish. the problem was that is is a little short for someone with a long torso and it is almost too revealing...the v is so plunging you would have to either pin it our wear a cami. the beads on the ties on the sleeves are also rather heavy and they swing and roll around on your arm...maybe wouldn't bother some but it was a return for me.,0

very well made with a relaxed yet feminine fit.
the cobalt blue accents are not as vivid as they appear online, was slightly disappointed with that, but being more subtle will make it more wearable...so no ""oh she is wearing that jacket again""....
the forest green is rich and elegant.

1033,"I bought these assuming they would be the same as a pair of pilcro stet ankle jeans i bought a couple of years ago. this pair has less stretch than my older ones, so they are a bit tighter. i'm 5'2"" and these are more like a perfect length regular jean (rather than ankle). i always have trouble finding jeans that fit my curves, but smaller waist. these are a bit big in the waist, with the butt and legs fitted. all-in-all they are a nice looking durable denim that flatters.",1
886,I purchased this top in blue and liked it so i ordered the red color. i hated the way the second one fit. i'm concerned the blue will not wear well after seeing the way the second one looked!,0
872,"This top looks much nicer on the model than in-person. i tried it on, it didn't look flattering and was shorter than i like. in the picture i really like the top with the design and frills on the side, gives the model a waist. in-person the design doesn't stand out much and the frills look wrinkled.it is also sweatshirt material and a tad stiff. i am sending it back. it just didn't look as flattering. also, it seemed more fitted at the top than bottom.",0
1083,"This is my third byron lars and as usual it is absolutely gorgeous and so worth the price. it completely flatters the body and all the details add so much interest, creating a very unique dress.",1
866,"I was so excited to receive this shirt and so disappointed when i tried it on. it's a lot fuller than it looks in this picture or maybe it's because i ordered a large? i'm 5'8"", 180lbs, 36d bra size and can fit into a large at retailer just fine but it made me look huge! not flattering at all and it was so full that it looked like a short dress!",0
1020,Wow! love this skirt! and i totally agree with reviewers--this item runs a full size small. i am normally a true six on bottom and it was a bit too tight considering i would wash/dry/shrink. the size eight is perfect. fabric is very good twill and forgiving... $19.95 and 40% off!!! cannot wait to wear my bargain skirt next summer!!!,1
910,"It's thin knit with a unique and pretty neckline, but unfortunately it's scratchy will not last. i just received it and it looks like it would fall apart after a few wears. it's a nice shade of offwhite at least. for me it's a no that will get sent back straight away.",0
984,I really love this brand and i love the fit of this blazer. my bottons were loose on this jacket and i got the rose color too and i do agree with the other reviewer that the color is more terra-cotta. great for spring and cool summer night. it runs tts im a 36dd and the medium fit nice.,1
1066,Chic and comfortable even in 90 degree heat. so easy to wear.,1
912,Runs small. arms very short and hits in the wrong place across your chest. would not recommend.,0
1082,"I was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for spring/summer. for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses. the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all. the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown. this dress has no shape to it, although probably comfortable, not flattering. i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture, in person.",0
872,I love this top. the design is flattering and the fabric drapes nicely. the length is perfect and can dress it up and down.,1
869,"I was debating getting a large in this top but went for the medium, boy is it huge, the jersey fabric is quite thick which makes the sleeves bulky and uncomfortable, even the small would be giant! 
for reference i normally wear a size 8/10 my chest is 34 e and this was just so so huge, it hung so badly of my chest that it looked frumpy and made me look bigger than i am.
the colours are true and nice and vibrant... definitely size down with this one",0
1060,"I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down from a s to xs. i was worried about the length of the torso since i'm long in that area, but the xs still worked great. it's a totally adorable jumpsuit with a nice fit. my biggest peeve with this was that it came dirty on the hems...like it had been dragged on the ground somewhere. unfortunately, there were no more xs online once i got it though, so i will keep and try to clean. this is not the first time in recent months that i have recei",1

only order this suit if you're super, super tiny on the bottom.",1
868,This sweatshirt is extremely comfy and stylish. i am happy with the item and it runs a snag large but perfect for a sweatshirt.,1
993,"This is the perfect pencil skirt! the pattern is flawless!
the top shown with it here online is outrageously expensive! i paired it with a lace turquoise top that retailer has in stores and you can also wear it with a wine colored top. i would not wear it with black because you just lose the stunning colors.
if you love fall colors this skirt is perfect!!",1
1028,"I have been looking for a quality pair of black skinny jeans for a while. after reading the reviews, i had such high hopes for these jeans. i bought it in my usual size 28 and while the top part fit perfectly, i found that the bottom was too tapered in and ultra skinny making it not look right. sadly, i had to return.",0
375,I just received this jacket in the cream color. it is so cute! you can change it from 3/4 to full length sleeves. i ordered both an xs and s and kept the s after i saw that i could cinch the waist to fit better. in the picture it looks a bit boxier than it really is possibly because not cinched. the material is good quality and the jacket is complete with attention to detail from the buttons to the jean contrast pull on the zipper. i love this jacket! it is a good cross over from athletic to cas,1
1121,"Once i saw this trench coat i thought it was so cute! i'm usually a small in retailer tops but can be a little broad so i decided to go with the medium (based on other reviews). when i received the coat, it was a little tight in the shoulders but still doable. i was surprised how thin it was (just a single sheet of cloth) and how full the skirt bottom was (however, there is a cute light blue seem lining inside). overall this trench coat is not really a warm coat, but more of a fun piece to dress u",1
1078,Looks great! it is more off white/tan then white though,1
872,"I sized down to an xs from my usual size small, and it fits perfectly. it is cropped but i like the swingy shape that will work well with high-waisted bottoms. i did have to get a replacement because my first top had some beading coming off when i received it in the mail, but this new one seems much more sturdy.",1
1095,"So i tried this on in the store and ended up with the size 8 (almost could have gone with a size 6) even though i'm 135lbs 5'6"" and 34 c. the dress is beautiful! the color is exactly as pictured - brilliant red. the linen is nice and summery. it does make it billow just a tad in the back because of the fabric but not anything to complain about. if i could change just one thing on this dress it would be the length. it just feels a little short for being such a classic and classy dress; just needs",1
1072,"This dress looked super cute in the picture and on the model. i ordered the petite style and it was still so big and way too loose. no shape whatsoever! i unfortunately had to return it. i love loose dresses but this one was way too big, loose and had no shape at all.",0
713,"Gorgeous wide leg sweats. i did wear them outside but i wore with a long t because they are slightly see through if they are snug on your bum. they don't seem like they will last long because they are thin. but the cut is adorable and very flattering. they were a gift, not sure i would have spent $78 but i do love them.",1
1110,Don't buy this dress unless you are normally a medium or larger. order it one or two sizes smaller than your normal size. i ordered an xs and it's more like a medium or large.,0
1095,"I love the colors of this dress, and i waited for the sale since it isn't really good for work. i wear size 6 in hd all the time, but this one doesn't fit at all on the top. the bust is cut for someone really curvy, but the bottom is for someone really straight. i don't know what they were using for a model, but this has to be tried on before purchased. the material is also rough, and there is no lining to protect you from that. i love my hd dresses for style and functionality, but this one is j",0
1081,Cute and comfortable. has layered design with black underneath which adds dimension and warmth. can wear in multiple seasons with and without jacket.,1
713,"I practically live in lounge pants, and i like the unique style of this wide-leg version. i'm generally a 6/28 in pants and ordered the small which fit well, if a bit big. the overall fit is great - slim at the hip with a nice wide waistband, and flatteringly-placed dropped pockets. the pants really slim my hips and provide a nice silhouette with the wide legs. the fabric is soft and flows and i did not experience any sheerness. as for color - i would call these a deep cool brown, definitely not",1
1052,"High quality, yummy soft fabric, gorgeous color. even with those three pros, this jumpsuit is not for me. i am 5'2"" and 150 lbs, size 10-12 m/l in the lines that retailer carries. i own one of their jumpers and it is very flattering! this one, however has capri pants, hits awkwardly at the midsection and makes my torso look even more square. on a tall, thin woman, it probably works!",0
1021,"I stumbled upon this item at my local retailer, and immediately had to true it on. the colors are so lovely in person. after trying it on, i was disappointed :( the material has a foamy/air feel to it, and the skirt seems to run small. needless to say, i didn't purchase this item.",0
1035,Best jeans! fit is amazing! buy them; you won't regret it!,1
903,"Perfect cozy sweater, nice details. exactly what i wanted to upgrade from sweatshirts.",1
881,This top runs large for sure and reminds me more of a tunic due to the length. nice detailing around neck and sleeves and the paisley print on the side hems is super cute. size down!,1
867,"Just bought this today in xl and i like it a lot. i am very busty so if i see an xl in most things i will try it on. i probably could have fit into a large though. this will look cute with leggings as it is long enough to cover your butt. i didn't know about the emerald color as it looked in store lights, but it is more blue-green at home. i like it even better. well worth $48!",1
1077,"As other reviews stated, this dress runs very large. it was a big potatoe sack on me. added to the fact that the green is much brighter than the online photos, it is going back!",0
867,I ordered an xxs online and it's still massive. the only thing i can use it for is a beach coverup. the embroidery is pretty but i will be returning.,0
873,"Cute pattern, but the shirt is very thin and runs small and short!",0
364,"I wish i could wax poetic about this gorgeous cardigan. i would have happily bought it in both colors except for the deal-breaking design flaw - the extremely tight sleeves. even if you have stick-thin arms, i don't know how you would ever be able to wear anything other than a tank top under it. sadly for me, this was a no go :(",0
866,Adorable with black pants or jeans. covers the part of your arm you might want covered :-),1
868,"I tried this (black motif) on yesterday in my local retailer store and fell in love...after sizing down! i do have to agree with previous reviewers that this top runs large. i am typically a s, but sized down to xs, and the fit was not even slightly snug. the material is soft and comfortable and i love the asymmetrical draped ""skirted"" bottom..very funky and arty-looking. i am 5'5"" and the regular length was great on me. as much as i will enjoy wearing it all summer, i also can't wait to layer it",1

1008,"I wanted to love this skirt. i love high-waisted skirts and the length seemed flattering on the model; it was not so flattering on me. the fabric is so lovely--truly the photos online don't do it justice. it's heavy and luxurious, wonderful for fall or winter, and the gold, gray, and navy floral pattern is not too flashy or bold. plus, pockets! however, the midi length did not work for me, despite the product's suggestion that it was a universally flattering length, just above the knee. i'm not",0

909,"This sweater is very warm yet light. the pink color is very cute, and the buttons are detailed very nicely! it hangs a bit low under the arms, and definitely tightens at the wrist. i ordered the xs size, and i find that i am unable to push the sleeves up. this is so beautiful and has a subtle uniqueness.",1
1092,"This dress is gorgeous. it looks exactly as it appears on model. the model must be wearing a petite because the regular size dress is maxi length on anyone 5'8. the petite is midi length and is perfect every where else. i am not petite, but this petite worked perfect on me for midi length.

1078,"I'm not a western girl but this dress is so adorable. i love the colors, it's adorable and unique. while its definitely a full swingy shirt dress i didn't find it overly large. i plan on wearing as a dress with sleeves rolled up. under the pilcro denim jacket it looks so cute. and open over jeans with a white tank like a jacket.",1

i will say that i have to often keep adjusting/pulling the top neckline down. it seems to want to revert to above-the-shoulders position. 

the fabric and quality feels nice and it was a great purchase for me!",1

834,"Like all maeve tops of this nature, i am absolutely in love! maeve always has a cute spin on an otherwise basic top. this top looks great with jeans, shorts, skirts, etc. i purchased it in all 3 colors. the blue is more of a robins egg blue, the orange is a great tangerine color (perfect for us tennessee fans!), and the ivory is a wonderful brownish-white. the ivory is my favorite because it's a very unique color.. i have a ton of white and ivory tops, but i do not have one in a color like this",1

for reference i am 5'5 145lbs, 38-30-40, 34ddd. the dress was low cut and showed too much cleavage for my comfort, but this may not be an issue for women with smaller breasts (or if you don't mind some cleavage showing). this length was also a bit too long, so if you are 5'5 or shorter you may want to order the petite size.",1
279,"These pants are great. i am 5'6"" and 133lbs. i normally wear medium for athletic bottoms. medium fits well except knee pit area. maybe because they are not very stretching fabric. however, they are still flattering. the material was thick enough and their print hides underwear lines.",1

i like this dress a lot, but it would have required tailoring the skirt. i'm petite, but for whatever reason most regular sized clothing fit me well, and petites clothes are usually too short in the arms or legs for me. the midi length is better suited to taller women. in the photo it looks like it hits just below the model's knee, but on me it hit below the fullest part of my calf.

936,Love this as a lightweight coat for cool to cold days. i love the squishy soft feel of the material. it works well with sweaters. love the deep pockets which works with my iphone plus and wallet. i love how simple and practical this coat is. the hood when not used as a hood makes a nice collar for the neck and head.,1

this dress was gifted to me, because i was gawking at it so often. i love it!!! i am petite, 5'3"" 118 pounds and i could do either the small or extra small. the small was a little more comfortable, because the extra small was a bit tight in the arms-but i went with the extra small anyway. in both cases the neckline showed a small amount of tasteful cleavage and i felt like a model with how many people complimented me on it. many people even took the extra step in compl",1

1086,"I love cloth and stone and the softness and prettiness of this fabric did not disappoint. this is not a dress, however. it is a long shirt. the sides were so short the you could see where my bum and hamstrings came together. leggings would ruin the look and as a shirt it would be totally impractical. for reference i am 5'8"" and 130 lbs. the small was the correct size, save for the length.",0

1123,I just purchased this amazing jacket in the moss color in my regular size small (34d-27-35) at the store because my husband had commented about how cool it looked and i absolutely love it. this is the softest jacket ever and you wouldn't even know it's not real leather. the moss is more of a cross between a dark grey and green and it's so neat how it goes with so many outfits. the moss green does not make it difficult at all to match up with so many other colors like you would think due to it's,1

854,Sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is. i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life. this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style. another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump . i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was $5.00!!!,0

1080,This is a beautiful dress. i ordered a size 10 to accommodate my bust (36d) which it did but the rest of the dress was too big. it was bulky in the middle area and did nothing for my shape. this would likely work best for smaller ladies.,1

unfortunately, i did not purchase this tank although i liked color and design.
first, it runs small than the regular size. 
it feels even smaller because my size is xs.
in addition, it tends to exaggerate a body line.
i am not quite sure why this happens, but maybe it is just the way this tank is.

however, if you have thin postur",0

830,I paired this top with pants and cardi from retailer and have really enjoyed wearing this outfit. i usually wear a large but due to how much material there is and how flowy it is i sized down to a m and it fits perfectly. only down side is getting the buttons buttoned behind your neck.,1

825,Not sure where to start with this top...it's that good! i am usually a large in most maeve tops and that's sizing up for extra flow. i ended up grabbing this piece of perfection in an xl only because it ran a little shorter than i anticipated and was kind of tight through my shoulders. i wanted more flow (as always) so i went up in size. for that reason i feel it runs pretty true to size. this is the perfect transition piece from summer to fall and is definitely a must have! it has sold out with,1
622,Bought this cami/tank on sale which i'm glad but it has a flap underneath like a bralette but not fitted..it kinda just drapes under the cami...the problem is it's not thick enough to offer the coverage you would want under a white tank ...but it was also too short so it caused a visible line underneath that showed through.that was higher than the bottom of my chest ..so it gave the appearance that i wore the wrong bra/undergarment...it simply looks awkward ...not sure if it would've been better,0

1042,Love all things mes demoiselles and these do not disappoint! the gold does not show in the picture but they sure do sparkle...in a great way. the fabric is rich and can be worn all year as they are light weight for summer but carry a look perfect with sweaters. i love them and with the sale on sale they were a steal and happy to have them...they will be that one piece that i will grab again and again. i love the look of peasant blouses and shorter vests...in a contrast print would be incredible,1
850,Lightweight silk with sweet details (ruffles) fits comfortably and nice for workplace with suit or more casual.,1
862,"This color is really cool because it can go with black, grey, or tan shoes. the back pleats are unique and do not add bulk. the back is also lined, so you don't need a tank. fits tts and i thought it was fairly flattering. on sale, this is a great deal.",1
1111,"I am 6'2"" and athletically built, and i usually have issues with dresses being long enough for me, but this beauty has the perfect fit and perfect length. it is very flattering. the weight of the dress allows it to move with you. it is form-fitting, but loose at the same time, so your body doesn't look lost in the material. you can dress it up with heels, or wear it with boots or sandals to be a bit more casual.",1
862,"Maternity like, and although the back is really cool, there is too much material in the front and it is almost like thin ribbed long underwear/pajama. returned.",0
927,Like the swingy fit. looks nice with a long fitted tee underneath and skinny jeans. the color online says black but it looks more like a faded black like it has been washed too many times.,1
935,"My conscience screamed at me not to buy this sweater and i wish i had listened! i noted the fact that it was acrylic and also the fact that it was oversized. but i also loved the design and can't resist anything with mustard yellow. i was instantly disappointed when i received it, almost didn't even try it on. how can they possibly charge $185 for terrible itchy 80's acrylic? it looks cheap, it feels cheap and it didn't even fit well. only redeeming quality: easily returnable!",0
872,"I just purchased this adorable top at my local retailer store, not really expecting to find anything, i saw this one so i tried it on in my usual size small and it fit me perfectly (34d-27-35). i bought the black with the colorful print and think it's even prettier in person. it looks cute with the ties either open or closed and the material is nice and soft. also, the arm holes aren't too large which is always a nice plus:)",1
1033,I ordered these a size up because i'd just had a baby and knew i needed a bigger size. my pre-pre baby size (chubby phase) were size 8/29. these fit like a size 4. way too small. very disappointed!,0
863,"It's too hot here in ca to wear this yet but i can't wait for cooler weather. i tried it on with skinny jeans and it's darling. love how it's much shorter in front with the side splits and long back to cover the bum. perfect for leggings. nice slim, but not tight fit.",1
1094,"I bought the dress that has the cream skirt with large flowers. i wore it for a wedding and was not only very comfortable with the pockets and the cotton top, i looked good. i got a lot of compliments on the outfit. people thought it was a shirt and blouse rather than a dress. i loved the high low skirt. the sizing was accurate and the dress is easy to clean.",1
1078,"Love this dress!!! i agree with the other reviewers, i had to size up one size, but then it was perfect. i'm 5'5, 125 lbs. and the size 6 worked great.",1

1080,"The print on this dress is really pretty and the styling with the lace is a nice touch. unfortunately, it runs quite small in the bust, so i had to return it. for someone that is small busted, it will be quite cute. everywhere else it is true to size.",0
868,Do not buy! i used my 15% discount on this. what a waste. my usual sizes range from s to l depending on what brand. i should have gotten a small. i don't think that would've helped. it was so awkward looking. nothing like the model. it made me look as if i had gained 15 pounds. it was waaay longer in the back-like a mullet. the material was really thick. it is more appropriate for fall. i had high hopes for this-to dress up or down. it was just so ridiculous.,0
1115,"This coat is absolutely beautiful - an instant stunner. the style is very classy and timeless. it is definitely more of a lightweight coat than true cold weather wear. yes, it does run large, but that is the cozy look of it. it is not meant to be form-fitting. my one gripe is that - especially at the price point - if it's not going to be especially warm, it should at least be otherwise functional. the coat i received has pockets cut on the outside, but they are sewn shut. a coat without pockets?",0
768,So thin and see thru it's not even wearable in public. extremely cheap and ill fitting for any price let alone this price. i feel like they will rip the moment i wear them out. going back.,0
873,"I saw this on sale, and it looked lovely online. i really wanted to love it when i received it. it looked great, but once i tried it on, it bunches up in the back. it looks awkward. the lace and small details are pretty, but the fit is just off. returned it in the store.",0
1095,"I pretty much am in agreement with the first, original reviewer on here. big disappointment, especially if you have hips and are busty.

pros:
- great breathable fabric.
- cute look overall.
- sash in front brings it all together.
- buttons are hidden under a panel of fabric, which is a nice touch.

829,Wonderful colors and fit tts. love the style. can were on or off the shoulders . love it!!!,1
631,This is a lovely little nightie. i am a size 8 and i bought the medium and it fits perfect. it's soft and lightweight and not as see thru as i thought it would be. very light and airy and the sale price was great!!!,1
1098,"Tried this dress on in the store and could barely button at my chest but the waist and length were perfect. ordered a size up and two sizes up online. went with the two sizes up because it did not pull as bad across the chest, though now it's a bit ""blousey"" around the waste. fabric is a little thin. similar to other reviews the slip is a little weird/wonky. i'm keeping it because i like the idea of the dress but i'm not sure about the lifespan with how gauzy the material is.",1

1081,"How could this not be flattering to every figure? bunching of fabric is awesome at hiding imperfections (i know, i have become a master at hiding some of my residual baby weight for years now). this, paired with a darker color (and not black, yay!) makes for a perfect combination in a dress. i love that this is a deep purple, it is a dark color which is slimming, but in addition it has more appeal being colored. and it is so versatile! wear it along or with a cardigan/jacket on top. heels or boo",1
868,"This shirt is just as great in person as it is online.  it's a substantial fabric which is not see-through which seems hard to find these days with whitish tops.  the color is more off-white without looking yellow.  i ordered a small and medium because i was concerned about the length and tightness in sleeves.  they fit almost the same with the only difference being that the upper sleeves on the small were just a tad bit more fitted, but not in a bad way.  i'm 5'5"" and found the length to be jus",1
941,I am in love with this sweater. i am 5'4 and wear a size 8 and bought a large. perfect length and fit. will wear with jeans or leggings. the quality was amazing and i can't wait to wear it!,1
552,"I love these jeans. i am usually a size 27 or 28 in boyfriend jeans and i kept the size 28. i chose the baggier fit. the size 27 did fit, but it was a more fitted look. so i guess i would say you could definitely go with your regular boyfriend size and pick the fit that you prefer. i really feel like this is a jean that you should try on before purchasing, but the availability of these makes it almost impossible. i literally stalked the site so i could purchase both sizes and choose the ones tha",1
872,"I ordered this online and was surprised to see yellow in the pattern when it arrived. i can't see that in the online photo. i didn't like the pattern at all when i saw it for real. the shirt is very loose, fits much like the model photo (i ordered a small, 5'6 140lbs). just looks kind of frumpy and the pleat down the front makes the front hang heavily.",0
829,"The skiers, cats, and puffin patterns are adorable and i was very tempted to keep the shirts just for the patterns. unfortunately, the fit was awful. i am short and need to highlight my waist and this shirt did the opposite. the skier fabric is also see-through. the tenting issue could be fixed if you belt the shirt or tuck it in, but it is not very long. 100% rayon fabric is a bummer too. the shirt was snug at the bicep, but not as bad as i expected from the reviews. i sized up from an 8 to 10.",0
1065,"I took these out of the package and wanted them to fit so badly, but i could tell before i put them on that they wouldn't. these are for an hour-glass figure. i am more straight up and down. the waist was way too small for my body shape and even if i sized up, i could tell they would still be tight in the waist and too roomy in the hips - for me. that said, they are really nice. sturdy, linen-like fabric, pretty color, well made. i hope they make someone very happy!",1
986,"I own several of retailer's kimonos, & this has to be the prettiest. the colors are rich & more beautiful in person. i can't wait to pair this with jeans & shorts this summer!",1
927,"I ordered this in two sizes and have only received one so far, but i think i really like it. that said, the one i got weirdly has pockets not shown in the images, which makes it seems more professorial than i'd prefer, partly because i am a professor and don't want to dress like one if i can help it. that said, i really need a floppy, easy cardigan, and this might well be it.",1
873,Love this top! red color is a bit orangey for my taste but overall a fabulous piece.,1
867,"The fabric is really gorgeous, and the lining is lovely and soft. unfortunately being on the petite (short) side, it just didn't look quite right on me. i felt a little swallowed up. i wish it had worked because it's so lovely!!",1

1081,"I really want to like this dress - it's beautiful, but it just fits like a sack. the yoke exaggerates my bust and the dress makes me look 20 lbs heavier. perhaps if you are tall and thin like the mode, or small chested, it would be great! the quality and color is beautiful.",0
1110,"Gorgeous dress! love that it's flowy, soft, and fits very well. it does run a size smaller. i usually wear a 4 and went with a 2p one this one. the sleeves are a bit tighter on the petite than the regular in the same size.",1
850,It's hard enough for women to find clothing that will make them look as beautiful as they feel but add a bigger bust size (i'm a 36dd) and it makes it this much harder. i ordered this top because of how beautiful it looked on the model and the price. when it arrived i was so excited! retailer does such a beautiful job with the way they handle their items! it was wrapped beautiful and no damage. i ordered a size 8 knowing that my chest could be a potential problem. the too itself is gorgeous! i did,0

966,I was wavering on this post purchase but then decided to wear it to a store opening event and double digit people asked me where i got it or commented that they liked it. i guess i made the right decision! the inside is a super soft gray jersey knit. wears great with black.,1

1110,"Everything about this dress is beautiful except for the hemline. the color is beautiful; the old-fashioned, wispy femininity is beautiful. the dress probably could use something better at the waistline besides elastic, maybe ribbons to tie, but the hemline is what kills it. it is half a normal-length dress (in the front) and half maxi dress (in the back). the designer should have chosen one or the other, not both, and it would have been much better. for the category of aesthetic/design, i would",0

1094,This dress you will want to try on in the store. it is very thick and stiff fabric. the whole front is embroidered and the big drawback for me is that waist seam. there is absolutely no give in that waist. this is not stretchy fabric and not easy for just any body type to wear. sad because it is very pretty on the rack!,0

i did size down on this one, but i didn't have to. that depends on the kind of fit you are looking for. sizing down did make the shirt more form fitting in my chest area, but also did make the garment somewhat less comfortable in the armpit area for being tighter (but not too tight). my normal size would have alleviated this problem, but also would have left the shirt with not a whole lot of shape. i opted to have a little shape and deal with the fabric slightly digging into my",1

834,You know how you look in your closet and things just say i'm perfect for today. this top is like that. i got it a few weeks ago and have worn it often because it is so easy and hangs really nice. i bought the black one and am considering the off white one.,1

the color is really lovely though!",0

877,"The shirt is nice, but not as nice a material as i was hoping, but i kept it anyway. but after washing it, it is even more disappointing, not very soft and now kind of an odd length. hopefully it will grow on me, but wouldn't recommend it especially for the price.",0

831,A sweet tunic with the distinctive lace hemline. the length is great - just right to wear with skinny jeans or over leggings. not too long but long enough for comfort over leggings! more of a boxy fit (just as expected). wore it with my skinny jeans and short boots and got many compliments.,1
862,"I bought this in the white, size m (140lbs., 5'8"", 34b) because i wanted a baggy fit, which i got, so this is tts. the white is more of an off-white rather than a bright white, which i like because i happen to be looking for an off-white tee. and the shape is good--even in a larger size, this tee nips in at the waist.however, the quality of this tee is lacking, as it is the typical, cheap, marled, slightly see-through material that seems to be everywhere these days and the band on the back of th",0

916,"This sweater is beautiful and looks exactly as pictured in terms of fit, length, and color. the fabric is super soft and not at all itchy - feels soft like a boucle type knit. the sleeves are 3/4 length and the weight is maybe a medium-weight (not super warm). i wouldn't see this taking me too far into a northeastern winter, but for right now it's perfect!! fit is tts :)",1
868,"I had such high hopes for this shirt! i got it in both the black and moss (which is a beautiful color). however, the ruffle was just too big. i put it on and immediately felt like a circus clown. it would probably be beautiful on a woman with a more straight figure with fewer curves, but on me, it was not flattering at all.",0
1078,"When i first opened this dress and tried it on i thought it was adorable. it is very flattering on my hourglass figure and hides my recent baby weight. the problem is the hem. it was already rolling up when i took it out of the package, and i should have noticed and returned it, but i figured the problem would be easily solved by a good ironing. well, it wasn't, and it gets worse every time i wash the dress. it's like the hem isn't constructed properly.",0

895,"I recently noticed that my trusty black cardigan, that i've had for years, was getting thin in the elbows and just kind of ragged, so out i went on the long journey to find the perfect cardigan with detail. this cardigan fit the bill, with a perfect fit and lovely texture, making it not just your average sweater, to go with my style. can't say anything bad about it!",1
909,"The blue color is beautiful and what attracted me to this sweater. the draped front is very flattering and the fit is true to size. unfortunately the banded hem creates a pouching effect that is very unflattering. i really wanted to love this sweater, but just can't figure out how to wear it without poofing. i think this is the reason it is tucked in in many of the model shots. it is still a pretty sweater and it may work with for some.",1
125,"This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however, like a previous reviewer, the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted, without all the excess fabric at the bottom, it would have been perfect. again, the color, the lace, the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came",0
863,"The fit of this top on me was much more boxy than on the model, maybe the fault of my fuller bust. my usual small definitely didn't reach my hips as it does hers, and appears wider. i'm not even sure the v is as deep! again, could be me. but i'm keeping the top because it is just so darn comfortable. as for not looking too top-heavy, ill just have to make it work.",0
1098,This dress is so beautifully embroidered with really cool mix of colors. it is pricey but i do think it will stand the test of time and become an retailer vintage piece. planning to wear it now with wedges and in the fall with booties and a light sweater.,1
1125,"I picked this up during the bf promo and very happy to find my size 10. i was watching this coat, i call this really a topper, because it is not heavy and finishes an outfit, i went up to a size 10 because it runs slim as noted in the description and the reviews. i find this piece to be a reminder of the old retailer pieces i have collected over the years ( since 2001!) my chest is a 34dd and even then the 10 is snug. i can't wait to wear this bold statement piece, i purchased the bailly 44 navy p",1

829,"I did not like this top at all-but had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have. it is polyester-i thought it was cotton so there's the first reason i didn't like it. secondly, there is a piece of fabric behind the laces, presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat. it wrinkles up behind the lacing, making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top. it is too long for me, the top hitting at top of thigh.

first, it is way too short for me, especially on the sides because of the war the ruffled bottom lay, to wear as a dress. it was more tunic length- but i wouldn't want to wear pants underneath because it would take away from the overall aesthetic. also, the ruffled sleeves give me unwanted volume th",0

950,"The photos don't look it, but the one i received was a cropped length. the bottom of the sweater's longest parts didn't even reach the top of my mid-rise pants. and i'm 5'3"" so it wasn't that the model is a lot shorter than me unless their models are 4' tall. 

disappointed since i wasted my retailer discount on this!",0
951,"I thought this was such a beautiful cardigan from the online photos. i ordered it in the small size but the fit is strange. the arms and wrist cuffs are so large it cannot be pushed up to stay out of the way for things i would like to do when wearing it (i'm a teacher and my classroom is that kind of environment). i was also confused by the front ""collar"" ribbing and how it was supposed to lay - open, folded over, partly folded over - it just didn't seem to have a particular style to this area.",0
1094,"When i first saw this online, i knew i had to have it. so, when dresses were 25% off, i grabbed the deal! it's perfect. it's super soft and an appropriate length. i love the bell sleeves-they're ultra feminine and slightly trendy, but not too much! i definitely recommend this dress! reference: 5'7, 140ish lbs--size 27 in jeans, xs/s/4 in tops and dresses and the small fit me better than the xs.",1
940,It breaks my heart to say this but i had to return for shape issues. i am not a fan of dolman sleeves (they make me look big and bulky) and i wished i would have known that prior to purchasing. it is unfortunate because it is a really beautiful knit and quality. i could see this working better on someone tall and thin.,0
394,"I love this suit, the bottoms ran a bit too big on me. i'm usually a small, but an extra small would have fit more comfortably. the small wasn't huge, so i kept with them and im still very happy with this purchase.",1
408,"I bought the stained glass top/bottoms. the print is very pretty. however, the tankini top itself is not well-made. the front of it (chest area) turns out so that you can see part of the inside of the suit (which is white). it doesn't lay flat around the top, and so it shows more of your chest on one side. for the price, i don't think it is worth it. i don't like to wear it because it makes me feel uncomfortable.",0
1077,"This dress is very cute on. very flouncy. i know it looks like a gingham dress, but it's a more like a silk dress with a gingham pattern. the one issue i had was that it ballooned out at the back where you tied it on any size (bug or small), and i am larger on top, so i don't know what would happen with someone with a small chest. i wouldn't have minded if it did the same thing on the front, but it was just the back.",1
862,This was so large on me that it looked awful. huge armholes and a baggy mess. material was nice and i loved the design. not sure a smaller size would even help.,0
1082,"I i hesitate to say that i don't recommend this dress,it really is so pretty,but a different fabric might have worked better. more importantly,the cut is not right,for me anyway. the neckline is a little high and the dress starts to flare out from the lower end of your boobs and continues all the way down giving a very wide lower half,way too much fabric at the bottom....looks like a triangle . if they' done a scoop neck and a shift style it would have been perfection",0
1078,Really comfortable dress to wear.  pretty flower design.  good fabric and ribbon details are well placed. thankful it came with a cotton under slip because it's very sheer fabric and i didn't have to think of  what to put underneath.  have worn it twice since it shipped and i'm really happy with my purchase.  online order and shipment was super fast too.,1
1078,"Perfect dress for the fall in texas. the velvet is on point for this season. the dress is very roomy on the bottom half...wish it was a little more fitted. but, overall a great dress, got tons of compliments!",1
854,I was not a fan. cute design but the sweater was not soft it felt thick like a weird blanket. the arms were small and the body was big... odd combo. the material didn't make me want to put it on. it went back.,0
872,I live in a hot and humid climate so this tank is perfect for everyday use. you can dress it up or down and the lightweight material keeps you cool. i bought it in 2 colors and may go back for more. i wish i would have found them sooner.,1
829,"This is a great feminine top i just wish it were a little bit longer for my taste, it hit about two inches below my belly button. it was a little snug around the belly area so that's why i feel it runs small for the brand, usually the brand runs true to size but not for this top",1
450,"I was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much. sadly, no. first of all they run small. i am between a s and xs in most brands, bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side. these felt a little snug and short, but i decided to keep them. the first time i washed them, they were ruined. i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer, plus a delicate cycle, no dryer. the lace is man",0
865,This sweater is a perfect transition piece!  the material is really soft. while it has the shape of a poncho it is cut nicely and doesn't make you look like a big blob.,1

875,"I usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops, ordered this top in an s and it was so wide on the sides and huge it fit like a tent.  not even remotely flattering.  i thought about ordering it in an xs, however, i could tell the xs was still going to have way too much fabric.  back it goes.",0
975,Love this jacket. it fits very well and is super comfortable. you can wear it to work or on the weekends. super versatile!,1
825,"This top is very cute, but i found it runs small in the bust, which is unusual for maeve. i will have to return it. you may want to size up, if you have a generous bust.",0
1022,These jeans look better in person - the pattern is more subtle than the picture online. these run true to size for ag denim.,1
1147,"Finally received this in the mail today and was very disappointed. i am swimming in the xs (5'4"", 110lbs). the colors are much more vibrant that shown in the pics - the green is a bright kelly green, the red is much more red than rust colored, etc. and it's a sweater coat! for the price i was expecting it to be lined and higher quality. i don't doubt that it will be warm, but can't justify the price. it's going back to the store.",0
906,"I like the design and the color of the cardigan (i got green). i like the details on the back. the cardigan is tts, the shoulder width and sleeves length seems perfect (for reference: 5'7"", 125 lb, got size s).

the problem for me is that the cardigan is not as long as it looks in the photos for the rose color; the pictures for the beige show the length more accurately. it may work for a smaller lady, but i like my cardigans a bit longer and cozier.

also, it is not just that the material is",0
868,"Really cute top, the material is soft and feels like great quality. love the loose cut and slight detail to the simple shirt.",1
1080,Really wanted to love dress but something was off with fit. fabric is lovely and zipper detail nice unfortunately style was not for me.,0
1078,I love this dress's gentle blue lace. the silhouette is just as seen in the pictures. i found the dress tight in the chest and had to size up one size (6 to 8).,1
683,I love this sweatshirt! new favorite! it has a comfy meant to be oversized fit... love the little inspirational quote... and it's the kind of sweatshirt you want to live in! so stinking soft! got lots of compliments at the gym and the pick up line at school!!!,1
1104,"Great cut and fit. tts. size 6 fit my 5'5"", 135 pound frame (34b/c bust) wonderfully. my sister and best friend loved it on. but i'm returning. the color is more of a very bright orange than red. i would want to wear this in the middle of summer but the all-polyester fabric is hot. i have too many dresses in my closet. cute as it is, i'd just never pick this one. love to see this design in lighter fabric and different color options. 1-2"" longer would also be a slightly better length.",0
820,"This top does look better online and one reviewer said. it also looks good in-person but runs small. i usually wear xl, in some cases l. i tried l, it was small so i sent it back for xl. the xl fit perfectly at the top but was tight at the bottom. the bottom pulled at the seams, so i am sending it back. the embroidery itself is very pretty, it is a nice dressy top that can be worn with multiple colored pants or leggings. it just didn't fit me at the bottom. i think it would work better for a lea",1
862,"Sadly, going back. ordered m, light color option, very difficult to pull over my head, not a good sign. got it on and neckline looked attractive (height w/o being a mock turtle), but whole thing a bit small around middle. could order the l, but i'm not liking the feeling of the fabric, it feels tight with restrictive and nonuniform stretch: 33 cotton/27 poly/27 acrylic and 95 rayon/5 spandex ""contrast"", which must mean the stripes. combine w/fact that the two wide stripes are right at my middle",0
1094,"Beautiful shape and colors but the fabric felt heavier than i imagined. sort of like heavy drapes. also, the length (as others mentioned) was too long. i am not normally a petite but the regular was too long. unfortunately, it has to go back.",0
1095,"This dress was not what i had hoped! from the online pictures, i had high hopes, but the fit was really wonky and the material seemed cheap. the arm holes were too big and made the dress seem more like a bathing suit cover up than a classy summer dress. needless to say, it's going back!",0
1104,"Lovely dress ,comfortable fabric and great cut .
the combination of the alignment of stripes works beautifully and is very figure flattering.
versatile to keep casual or dress up with a great pair of shoes.",1
725,"I thought this tank would be so cute and comfy for my daily walks, but it's completely see through.  i sized down one size based on a review from another website and it fits ok, but it's hard to say if it runs tts because i have nothing to compare it to.  if the fabric was a little thicker, this would be the perfect tank.  unless your planning on layering this, i wouldn't recommend.",0
1078,"The dress at first glance is pretty, feminine, and a timeless shape. sadly the quality just isn't there.  i ordered online and was excited trying it on (dress fit true to size for me, all be it a little snug in the chest).  the zipper is super cheap, hard to get up or down on or off the hanger.  the appliquã©s are sewn onto a super flimsy netting, already coming detached without even having worn it.  i could see this dress catching on ""everything"" and tearing easily.  given the quality i'm return",0
1111,"This dress was exactly what i was looking for- a rich, luxurious fabric, a deep neckline, and a tightly cinched waist. i have a full bust and, while the snug waistband was a negative for some reviewers, for me it is a little miracle. this dress fit like a glove and was flattering in my usual size. thank you!",1
1041,"I thought this was much more of an overall than a jumpsuit. after trying it on in a store (must have been a return), i could tell that the medium was snug and usually i am between a medium or a small. the straps were a little hard to manage. it is cute and i think cuter than on the model.",1
835,Gosh this is beautiful but it is way wider and puffer than i imagined it would be. in fact it almost looks like a costume or something you would buy handmade. i would just feel silly wearing this out to dinner with a group of friends. i gave it high ratings on the quality however because it really is beautiful but the design is just not what i had hoped for.,0
1072,"I noticed some reviewers didn't like the loose shape of the dress. it is indeed a dress with a looser silhouette than most! but that's what makes it unique and expensive looking! i loved the extra material in the dress, especially in the back, it flowed gracefully and beautifully. i can imagine wearing this dress for many occasions and feeling instantly chic with minimal effort! :) it was also very figure flattering! i ordered the size l and it was a perfect knee length, so i would say this dres",1
825,"Beautiful blouse in theory, however, on my 5'9"" frame it came off like a costume. i truly had a nice chuckle as i looked at myself in the mirror. had to sadly return it",0

829,"...the print is so sharking, and i love the way it looks on the model -- but i'm a more curvy figure, and the boxy-ish cut plus rather stuff fabric in front is incredibly unflattering. ordinarily i love everything made by maeve, but this one sadly must be returned... on a thinner/straighter-shaped person i expect it would be great.",0
1025,"I live in blue jeans - and i'm extremely particular about style, fit, and fabric. an eternal fan of ag, i tried these on the recommendation of a sales association. in the past week - i've dressed them up, dressed them down, and wished i could wear them to work! the wash is an especially versatile shade of indigo. incredibly flattering fit. if you're going to splurge on one essential this season...these paige jeans are definitely a candidate.",1
1078,"Great material. a bit loose in the middle / lower half. doesn't belt well. it could be 3"" shorter, considering alterations. i'm 5'7"" the model is 5'10"", so yeah 3"" shorter would be cute!",1

984,"This blazer is really well made, it has a nice weight and stretch to it. i think it might run a bit on the large size, i am sometimes a small and sometimes an xs and the xs is perfect. it's a great blazer to throw on to cinch together a casual yet put together look. i don't think the picture here does it justice. it will be getting a ton of wear in my work wardrobe. i love it!",1

1092,"This dress is beautiful and unique - the cutouts and lace really stand out. however, the dress was huge on me and that is rare with moulinette souers. i usually get a 0 or 0p in this brand due to the bust sizing being generally smaller but the 0 regular was huge and the armholes really big. the petite may have been better but felt that it would have been too short. while the design is beautiful, there were several areas on the dress where the threads were unraveling. for reference, i am 24 waist",0
870,"I wanted to love it - the color is great, the embroidery pretty, but the stiff scalloped sleeves were just too much. if you have broad shoulders this is not the shirt for you. i think personally it would have been better had the material been softer.",0

1110,"So i have had to return this once so far because the stitching ripped out when i sat down. the little slip thing that goes underneath if cheaply made. i really wish this were just lined dress. i wear it with a blank tank top and leggings underneath. not worth the money, but i needed something to wear that was transitional.",0
1078,"The patters/colors on this dress are much more stunning in person. it is lined and feels very well made. the pockets don't add bulk to the hip area as many times they do, which is great. the fit can be tricky if you have any semblance of curves. if you can, try this one on in a store before buying. for reference: i am 5'7"", have broad shoulders, am pear shaped (i have hips and a good sized rear end), 34b bust, weigh 145 lbs., and generally wear a size 6 or 8 for tops and bottoms. the size 8 fit",1

864,"I bought this because i thought it would flatter my boxy big busted shape and it does. however, while i liked the irregular hemline on the model, on my 5'5 frame it hits at a strange place and so i will hem it a little shorter. the fabric is extremely thin and not lined so this is definitely a light weight summer top even here in the south. i love the modern styling but the quality of the fabric is a concern, definitely no dryer on this one.",1
881,"This top is very strange. i agree with the other reviewer in that i think it's not cotton. it clung and got bunched up around my chest. like in a static cling way. there's just something about the way it hangs that is not flattering. too bad as i was really looking forward to wearing this but alas, it's going back.",0
860,Although the blouse is pretty it did not fit me well. i downsized two sizes and it still didn't hang well on my body. i think it looks great on the model and would probably look better on a thinner person. i am disappointed it did not work out and i will be returning it.,0

1110,"I am 5'10"" 150lbs and size 8 fits me perfectly. 
the print is lovely and the fabric has a nice flow to it. 
at this price point the dress should have a lining.",1
833,"A versatile, pretty and feminine addition to your closet. perfect with black pants, jeans, shorts...dress it up, dress it down.",1
1056,These pants are so great! they fit as expected and are a nice skinny crop but nothing too tight. the fabric is very soft making these pants incredibly comfortable. this was my first pair of the stet crops but will probably buy another pair in the future.,1

850,"This is a cute top, especially the material design. i like tops that go over my bottom and this does. if i had a problem it is with the sizing. the fact that it was only online so i could not try it on made it difficult to know really what size to get. some reviews said it was true to size and others said go down a size. i did go down a size but it still hangs a little big. but i still love the overall look. i am also petite which is what i ordered.",1
573,"I was so excited to receive this in the mail as it had been on backorder for awhile. the dress is beautiful, but run smalls the buttons on the back are nearly impossible to fasten. if you are single, good luck trying to get it buttoned. i'll be returning it.",0

751,"I was hopeful my size l would fit after another pair of leggings from antrho in this order was too small. these went on easier and i was feeling good until i reached the lower abdomen and everything came to a screeching halt. i'm not sure they are too small, rather, i believe, they are styled to be low-rise. not sure why anyone would want that in a legging, but i'm new to this athletic-wear trend. regardless, i won't be wearing these!",0

1100,"I understand the style of this dress is ""swing"", but there is just so much fabric, and it looked a bit like a tent on me. i ordered the s and i just found it to be too loose all over. the fabric is great and the colors are rich and lovely. this style would probably look better on someone smaller-chested, because there is no waist, it falls out from the bustline. cute dress, but i would size down.",0
886,"Absolutely in love with this shirt. the neckline is extremely flattering, and the shirt naturally comes away from the body.",1
933,This is a gorgeous jacket! love the softness and the style is unique and fresh. the color is going to keep me cheered through the winter. this will look great with a scarf and leggings.,1
860,"This is a very pretty blouse and i like the mix of fabrics. i bought this in my usual size and it fit nicely except for the fact it is much too long. i have a short torso, and all this does it just cling and sit on my butt. perhaps this would work very nicely on someone that was athletic or tall and slender. sad to say, i had to return this because of the length.",1
872,"This top was originally way overpriced. so i ordered it on sale for half price. still overpriced. it arrived yesterday and frankly i am disappointed. the quality is not great. it is like a jersey type material. doesn't look like the photograph at all. i like the color, but frankly, that's about it.",0
861,"I love this shirt but have 1 issue- that darn pocket. it's so awkward. it even looks awkward on the model. then, i bought another t-shirt by the same company from elsewhere and guess what? same awkward weird floppy pocket. it's so odd, i can't even explain it.",1
1081,"It's not totally apparent in all of the photos, but this dress does have a very noticeable a-symmetric hemline. i have read other reviewers that have said this dress is ""forgiving"" and a good choice for people with an hourglass frame. if you are truly an hourglass (small waist, larger shoulders and hips due to bone structure rather than weight,) this dress is a poor choice. the fabric of this dress tends to cling to the outermost hip, and the a-symmetry of this particular hemline not only draws",0
936,"The color and weave of this sweater is really beautiful and it looks very expensive. it is heavy- this is not a lightweight cardigan so save it for the coldest of days! i wore with a white tee like in the picture and jeans, and i did have to roll the sleeves up like the model. i'm not sure that i have a jacket that would fit over this sweater because it is somewhat bulky, but i am still very happy with the purchase. you could wear this at home to lounge in, or out and about for casual outings.",1
1072,"Ordered size 12, it fits but pulls a tiny bit in the midsection. also way too long, hits below my knees. the dress is beautiful: crisp black color, nice fabric, great neck. it's also the kind of dress that must fit well to look good. i had to return mine.",1
1078,"This dress makes you feel like a little kid. it certainly helps that it is an excellent twirling dress, for sure. i wish it had a little more definition to the waist--it just barely works for larger chested women, definitely on the line from being a little too baby doll shapeless. the colors are so beautiful and the fabric so light that it's hard to pass this one up. it's just too beautiful. i recommend it, but it's probably not for everyone.",1
906,This has quickly become my go-to cardigan! it's light which will make it great for the spring and summer nights. i got it in the rose... and loved it so much i bought the olive too. bought a small- fits perfectly! arm length is great too.,1
1025,"After being tentative to splurge on skinny jeans (i've always been a small flare jean-girl), i am thrilled to say i love these jeans. the rise is perfect in that it ""holds in"" anything you want ""held in"" and makes a slim shirt look even better. i have worn them with booties and regular boots alike and have no complaints. i was unsure of the jean's claim to not stretch out but have been pleasantly surprised at how they have kept their shape...even after sitting for many hours at a time. wash cold",1
354,Classic design with nice details. stays in place for those active bikini wearers.,1
867,I love this tee s much i bought 3 different colors! the back is beautiful. it is so comfy and soft but its added spice makes it perfect for those times you want a little more style.,1
854,Before i ordered this i noted the other reviews that said it was sheer but thought i would just wear a layer underneath. unfortunately it was one of the sheerest fabrics i've ever seen. would love it if it could have been a more substantial fabric. to me it wasn't worth the money even on sale.,0
999,"Love this skirt. i wore it to work after purchasing this, and i had at least 20+ people comment on how beautiful it is. many office ladies asked where i purchased it and one (who asked the cost) said it was worth the steep price. the green in this skirt really pops out, as do the gorgeous golden flowers. the pockets are a nice addition as well.",1
884,"This henley has a lot of very nice details (lace, embroidery). the material is soft and a little bit sheer (more so in the lacey sections). it is made in india and the style strikes me as a bit indian looking. the only thing i do not like is that there are two buttons along the v shape decolltage..but there are no button holes on the other side so they are purely for decoration (you can see those buttons in the enlarged detail view only). this irks me a bit, because i would like to button the sh",1

936,"This is a fun, cozy sweater. i feel you can dress it up and use it casual too. i bought the ivory in size s, i'm 5'2''. although i put it runs true to size, it's is a tad tight around my upper arms, not uncomfortable. i have normal to somewhat skinny arms, so i don't think it was my body type. i didn't check other sweaters in the same size to see if it was an isolated case. it is to be worn loose, it has quite a bit of material all around mid to lower part, just fyi.",1
861,"In my retailer this was hung over in the pj section, and it really has more of a jammie top feel... soft, thin and stretchy. it's super cozy and comfortable and it drapes really nice. mine seems to have stretched out a little, especially the neckline (and the little buttons have a hard time staying closed). i'm happy with it though for what it is - a great, casual day t.",1
831,"It's sheer, the design /print is casual, but on silk like material. had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer???",0
839,"This is a great top and worth the money. nice flow to it, soft material and light weight for hot summer days. many light weight tops are sheer and require a cami - this one does not which is key for those of us that live in hot climates. don't miss out!",1
272,"I was a little bit afraid to purchase this because of the price, but i am so glad i did because this is a gorgeous swimsuit. the quality is amazing, and the colors are exactly as pictured. i have a small-ish frame with a big bust, and this style keeps my figure very flattering without making my chest look too big or heavy.",1
861,"When i saw this shirt, i knew i had to have it! i got the white with yellow flowers, and the pattern is perfectly charming. i'm 5'2"" and petite with a short torso. the petite xs fit me perfectly! the material is pretty thin, so i hope it stays in good shape. until then, i can't wait to dress this up for work and dress it down for casual summer days.",1
866,"I was on the fence about keeping but the more i tried it on, the more i liked it. i feel like it will be a great winter casual top the reason i was on the fence was because its pretty big. i'm 5'4 and 108 and the xs is pretty voluminous on me. it's just so darn different and feminine though that i'm going to live with the fact that there is so much material. i think it is still cute. the fabric is also really soft on the inside so it will be cozy too.",1
1110,"This is a beautiful dress. it fits true to size. i have some issues around the middle and this just flows away from the body. i am 5'5"" and it falls to the knee on me, longer than pictured on the model. the fabric is a nice weight that can be worn three seasons. the print is pretty and romantic. i'm planning to wear this to my daughter's very informal wedding and know i'll be comfortable and look put together. this was a lucky find!",1
940,"I bought this coat 5 years ago and every fall/winter, i can't wait to wear it again. can't even begin to describe how many people comment on how beautiful and unique it is! it has worn well over the years considering how much it has been worn, but i just might be tempted to buy it again (which is something i have never done with a statement piece). the only design feature i would change is that it has no closure. i actually had a beautiful large antique button that i sewed on with a snap and it",1
1068,"Low waisted, weird liner.",0
826,"The mustard colour was much stronger than it seems in the picture and it wasn't pretty on me. plus the sleeves were very wide so that makes this not good for petite frames in my opinion. it does run big - i ordered m (and i usually take m or even l in retailer clothes), but i could have tried a s to make it less boxy. too bad though, because it's a pretty shirt and different.",0
185,These could barely fit over my calf and did not even broach my knee. i have big calves but i am otherwise i slim and normal sized woman. these are way too tight and narrow to enjoy or to get much use out of.,0
969,"I was walking by my local retailer and saw this in the window and loved the colors. it's a great combination and looks good with white jeans, and regular denim. i like the cuffs on the sleeves and the textured material. it is a kimono - so in essence it is not form fitting. it's meant to flow over whatever else you have on. i purchased the xs/s and i am a normal size 2 and it looks cute. i got lots of compliments when i wore it! there are slits on either side at the bottom hem as well which allow",1
1080,So despite reviewers saying this was too short i decided to try it anyways. the dress is adorable the print t g e pockets so cute but the description is incorrect. the petite falls 30 from shoulder which means it's right under your bum so you move anyway and someone gets a show. it's unfortunate because this dress is adorable. it would fit tts except length. unfortunately this one has to go back.,0
1150,"But, it just doesn't measure up. first, the slip/lining comes unattached if pulled slightly and it is very difficult to actually get it on - either stepping into it or pulling it over your head. and, once on, the top was a big snug and there was too much material at the bottom which made it look really bulky. unfortunately, i am finding this to be the case with so many of the items i buy from retailer lately. the material is really cute, but the dress isn't worth the price / effort.",0
1094,"I was so excited when this dress went on sale.  it is very soft and the print is so distinctive.  it is super comfy but not slimming or flattering at all.  i am a curvy girl,  wear a medium 8/10 and this made me look so wide!  the skirt is quit full,  a small would have fit but the top was tight.  so disappointing.",0
829,"I just returned this top. i agree with the previous reviewer. the neckline is way too deep, i ordered small and i looked ridiculous in it. also the ruffles didn't look so great on me either.",0
1078,"Like many of the other reviewers, i thought this ran a little big. i am a 5'5"", 110lb pear and xs was perfect - i also ordered the small to be sure. it is not quite as close to the body as the picture. the color is gorgeous and saturated. it hits me mid thigh in a good way. the fabric is crepe on the outside and silky on the inside and it has a beautiful, high quality drapey-ness. it is unlined but not see through. it arrived wrinkled and sad, but a warm dry iron really brought out how gorgeous",1
881,"I have been eyeing this top online and initially thought it was very fitted and structured as it appears on the model. upon trying it on at the store, i agree with other reviewers it is a tad boxy. i ended up sizing down to a small and it fits nicely. (5' 8"", 145, usually i take a medium or 6/8 in retailer tops). i can see where this might not work for everyone, but i found it to be a fun take on a classic ""tweedy"" look. i plan to add a pop of color with jewelry or even pair it with the pin",1
877,"Loved the print/pattern and the light grey.....i think it might have been better if reversed (it has a v in the back, and the front neckline was very intrusive and scratchy to me). i'm normally a small but got this in a medium and it was very short on me. wish it could have worked but returning it.",0

1100,This dress is so flattering and just beautiful in person. love it!,1

831,"This one is perfect for the taller ladies (or those looking for a longer fit). i was a little discouraged by a few short-fitting tops recently, and this one finally works for me (at 5'7"" with a long torso). awesome quality, not overly delicate, and beautiful detail.",1

pros:
- a-line so you could go down a size for a slimmer fit.

850,I love this top in peach! i usually wear a size 8 and ended up buying the large because that was all they had in store. it fits well but loose. i usually front tuck it in. what i love the most about this top is the perfect way it slouches off your shoulders. very effortless but doesn't feel like it is falling off. a few other off the shoulder tops i tried are either falling off or rising up (and you constantly have to pull them down over your shoulders) due to elastic in the shoulder. this top h,1
862,"I really love the idea behind this. however, the fit doesn't work for me. i'm usually a s or xs in retailer tops, and i often go with xs for sleeveless tops. this one runs small though - the xs was a bit too small on me based on length and width. the neckline was very high (higher than it looks in the model photo) and the armholes were too big. so i don't think sizing up would improve matters much due to the armhole issue. the other criticism is that the front is not lined.",0

844,Material was a tad rough for my liking. the color did nothing for my olive complexion. given the price of this shirt (even with 20% off) i don't think it's worth it. if i'm spending $100+ on a blouse i need to love it and i do not love this one...going back.,0

857,"I hoped, from the picture, that this would be more of a ""straight down"" sort of fit. retailer is usually really great at selling tops that flatter hips without having an obvious bell shape to them. however, the top had too much of a ""flare out"" bell-shaped vibe. i need to be able to wear this with maxi skirts in the summer, but this top would be too sack-like and billowy with those. i think it would only work with jeans/trousers. my final objection was the arm holes - the way they are cut,",0

i expect a lot more from a dress with this price. i'd recommend only buying on super-sale.",0

862,Happy with this top- slightly thinner material than i was expecting but that'll be fine with our hot summers. got the navy striped one- very pretty and extremely soft. washes well. i do wear an tank underneath though bc the armholes are slightly large and you can see part of my bra.,1

the fit is true to size, i tried the 27 and it was a nice snug fit around the bum (waist 28/29, hips 36, usually a 27 or 28 in jeans, sometimes even a 29 if they're super skinny).",0
1081,"I love this dress. it fits like a dream and is incredibly flattering. i vary between a 4 and a 6 in dresses, and the 6 was too large on the bust but the 4 fit great! the dress is longer than in the picture, the model must be wearing heels, but it doesn't quite hit the ground with flats. the fabric is light and airy, it comes across a little more formal in person but is versatile enough to be worn more casually as well.",1
872,Very cute top. the sleeves were more quarter length on me. looks great with jeans,1
1022,"These are a perfect staple piece: you can dress them up or down, and they're insanely comfortable! even if you hold a lot of your weight in your butt and thighs like i do, i feel like these pants do such a nice job of being form-fitting and flattering without squeezing the life out of you. i have always loved any and all retailer pants in this style, because they just fit so well and last a really long time. i will continue to buy these for many, many years!",1
873,"I really wanted to love this blazer...i've even tried it on several times hoping it would look better the next time around. (spoiler: it didn't :( ). overall, it makes me look pretty frumpy and not put together. i really love saturday/sunday brand and was hoping for a nice comfy blazer to wear to work. will be returning instead.",0
867,"I need t-shirts, these seem cute. a small runs loose, but it's comfortable and it does fit. i am turned off by the little side slits on all of this brand's printed tees. if i want to do a partial tuck to give myself a waist, because these shirts are cut generously, the little slits just throw the whole look off. i tried a few in the store, but left them all there.",0
829,"Goes well with lots of skirts and pants, including the culottes shown. only downside, and not a big one, the sleeves are finished with elastic instead of a fabric band, which looks a little cheap",1
868,"Not at all tapered at waist as suggested here by photos. i have wide shoulders and am slim, and this made me look big all around. i am doubtful a smaller size would correct this- i am 5'10"" and ordered a medium. also, it curls under a bit at the waist. one nice thing about the cream is that it is not see through. anyway, i purchased this to go with high waisted skirts but am returning.",0
970,"It is indeed cut to the shape of a trench. however, i think retailer should rename it as it's more like wearing a cardigan. it's soft and pretty which i like. however, i wasn't convinced to buy it since i have a gazillion long black cardigans already made out of the same jersey stretch material.",0
1087,"I am floored by the amount of positive reviews on this dress! when i received it, it looked nothing like it does on the model. the bottom looked like dirty sand and was completely wrinkled. if you have anything above a c cup, the top looks completely unflattering. i looked so top heavy in this dress! definitely not worth the price. so disappointed.",0

1086,This dress is beautiful on so many levels. the colors and print are amazing and the maxi sweater dress idea is unique. it fits true to size and is very flattering. my only issue is the amount of shine that it has from the metallic threads running through it. i would have preferred less shine which would make the dress more versatile.,1

i wish this had been linen or some more natural material but still recommend it as a good buy",1

850,It's hard enough for women to find clothing that will make them look as beautiful as they feel but add a bigger bust size (i'm a 36dd) and it makes it this much harder. i ordered this top because of how beautiful it looked on the model and the price. when it arrived i was so excited! retailer does such a beautiful job with the way they handle their items! it was wrapped beautiful and no damage. i ordered a size 8 knowing that my chest could be a potential problem. the too itself is gorgeous! i did,0
430,A great long line bra! beautiful and well made however it's tough to get the fit perfectly right. i usually wear a 32 b or 34 a and am 115lbs. the small was the best fit as the 32 (xs) was a very small 32. i could almost say it more of a 30 if that's even a size. it also rubs my skin few places so definitely not meant to be worn for more than a few hours. otherwise i recommend it!,1

1110,"I have been eyeing this dress for months and finally, a sale. the pattern is beautiful and is a great quality. the fit:
it is a swing dress, so if you are a bigger girl, this may not be flattering; try a belt though. the high neck could be a bother for some-it does fit close to the neck, but not tight.

i expected this sweater to be more flattering though. it is true to size, but the length is strange. it seems a bit too long, yet is too short to look like a longer tunic. or maybe the waistline is a little low... whatever it is, it makes me look like i have short legs.

1111,"This dress is a great dress for spring and summer (and early fall) events. it's surprisingly light weight and comfortable. you can pair different shoes with the dress due to the various colors which makes it easy to dress up and down. i definitely recommend if you're looking for a fun, floral, feminine dress.",1
899,I thought this shirt was really interesting online and it doesn't disappoint in person. i love the uniqueness of the shirt but wish the quality of the white fabric was a little higher. overall though this was a great find and i know i'll wear it again and again.,1

the fabric is nice and sturdy. the colors are more vibrant than online. 

the design however is terrible. when i put them on i double checked to make sure they weren't on backwards- the back is flat as a board but the front has these poofy pockets. the poor fit with the bright stripes gives a ""1920s circus diaper"" look which is not good.

1078,"I wanted to like this dress, but it just did not work for a bustier frame. the fabric is quite loose, does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy, so if you are well-endowed, your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs. as a result, the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips (as on the model), and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward. on smaller curves, this would likely be very flattering, but",0

984,"Wasn't too sure about this jacket when i got it in the mail - seemed a little boxy on - maybe a smaller size would've worked better but i want to be able to layer. however, i'm keeping it because it's versatile, i love the contrast of the front/back and the buttons on the sleeve (which actually button and un-button, meaning they aren't just for show and the sleeves can be easily rolled up). a great basic jacket with some neat details.",1
1033,"I really like these jeans, but order a size down. i'm typically a 14 and these were just too big. they stretch as it is and although they should have a baggier fit, they are just too baggie.",1

862,"I bought 3 shirts in gold, black and red. they arrived larger than expected. after the first wash and air dry they shrunk. i would have been thrilled but they shrunk to be shorter while staying too wide. also my black shirt faded a lot with one wash.",0
876,I purchased this in black. as in the other reviews the lace detail is a little snug in the arms but it did stretch. i did not have a problem with any fraying or quality issues. the shape is very flattering. i've been asked where i bought this several times.,1
1074,"I ordered this dress to wear to a summer wedding in san francisco. i liked that it had sleeves, a plus. when i was trying it on, i found that it was a little snug, then realized it was the slip, which is not too tight at all once the dress is on. it helps to smooth those little bumps. it is drop waist style, which skims the torso, then flares out prettily. all in all very complimentary, beautiful color, well made. very pleased; it will be comfortable and perfect at the wedding.",1

909,I love this pretty sweater. i am petite and thin and ordered the regular xs. the length was perfect- just below the hips. the sleeves are a bit long but you can pull them up a bit. this is a perfect winter dressy sweater to wear with black jeans or leather pants. the knit is very delicate and light but warm and the layered chiffon bottom makes it special.,1
1078,"I wanted to like this dress, but it just did not work for a bustier frame. the fabric is quite loose, does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy, so if you are well-endowed, your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs. as a result, the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips (as on the model), and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward. on smaller curves, this would likely be very flattering, but",0

836,"While overall it's a pretty top, there were a few surprises. the biggest one not listed is that the bottom has a thin elastic band! without it, the top would be wide, longer and flow. in the picture to get it to the length shown, the elastic is pulled up toward the waist. which could work for some, as you can adjust the length into a tucked in look. it could be cut off, and sewn, making a normal flowy top. i am a normal size 6 and the shoulders are off, and the sleeve length is long with elastic",1

1078,I love this dress. i read the reviews on it before i purchased and they were spot on. i have broad shoulders so i ordered the large. it was still plenty roomy but i wore a royal blue sweater with it and it pulled the waist in just enough to make it fit without a belt. i would buy it again!!,1

1087,This dress looks so cute in the pictures-i love the style. ordered typical size and it was huge-felt like many sizes too big.,0
975,"This is a sweet little jacket. i saw it in the store but was unsure because of the price. but after trying it on, i just fell in love! the cut is really flattering. the jacket does run small. i really enjoy the little pop of color on the sleeves. my only complaint is the buttons make me nervous, because they seem to be heavy and i worry that i'll lose one, but only on the front 2, the arms and back buttons seem to be just fine. overall this is a fantastic buy that is great for an office setting",1
1078,"So the dress is interesting. has an asymmetrical wrap look, short, sexy length (i'm 5'3"" and the petite barely covers my assets), and a neckline that implies sexy without actually displaying the girls- it crosses over and stays closed, but looks sexy and plunging. but the shoulders are what make it look matronly. they're wide- from neck out to the outer edge of my shoulder/upper arm. they show no shoulder at all, which is really an odd design when the rest of the dress is sexy-ish. i looked back",0
927,"I ordered this in size xl. the ivory was as pictured. the lace details were well-done. but, the length was much shorter than on the model. i'm 5 ft. 5 1/2 in. for reference. even the sleeves were on the short side, above my wrists. the main problem is how much it shed. just in trying it on, there was fuzz everywhere so i returned it. i love when retailer mixes lace into the knit of sweaters. this one just didn't work out.",0
966,"Love this vest! the color looks a little more brown in the picture than it really is--it's a deep forest green that goes great with jeans or black pants. a great piece for polished but casual style, and the fabric has a nice, soft suede-like finish.

if only the was *slightly* higher to hit my true natural waist, it would get that fifth star (but sometimes i wear petite sizes, so that might be the issue here--still looks good tied).",1

862,"Loved the bright pattern online and had hoped it had a similar fit to the tyla ts which i love. in actuality this was a lot boxier. the cut was shorter in length, too short for my 5'10 frame. the width was rather boxy and unflattering, particularly with the wide arm holes and flat cuffed sleeves. also the pattern looked a little cheap in person, way less spectacular than retailers typical gorgeous vibrant patterns. this is going back i'm afraid.",0
1081,"I was looking forward to receiving this dress. i am tired of all of the swing dresses - most of which are not flattering on my petite frame. i am also uncomfortable with dresses that fall much above the knee as i am somewhat older. the colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful. vibrant, but not too bright. when i got it on i was thrilled with the fit - until i looked at the back. there are pleats at the waist in back and there is way too much fabric. it looked like i had a bustle under the d",0

1094,"So many things to love: love the mod kind of style, the forgiving pleats and empire waist and the fabric quality. but the neckline is just way too deep. if they didn't pin the one on the model, i'm a monkey's uncle. that super low neckline takes what should be a nice day dress and turns it into something you can't really wear in a church or in front of your dad. i seriously considered altering it, but the waist is already so high, i felt it would ruin the line of the dress.",0

936,"I really love the look of this sweater and it seems to be of great quality. i will say the fit is a bit odd. the sweater is on the short side but is very roomy through the neck and shoulders. i ordered a small (5'6""; 120lbs) and would change for an xs but i'm afraid it would be cropped. i'm keeping it but wish it had a more uniform fit.
really beautify workmanship though.",1
949,"Much nicer in person -- the chunky knit reads more gray with black accents than ""blue"" as described here. there are lovely flecks of rust, blue, goldenrod, green throughout. super soft, stretchy; it's fine sizing down...otherwise the arm holes dip down very low. i'm usually a size 4/small and xs was best for me (33"" bust, long torso, broad shoulders). i can see wearing another layer underneath when cold weather sets in.",1

833,Runs big so size down. i love this top for many reasons but armholes are big so went to xs and i am usually a small or medium. xs was perfect and still long enough for me. gorgeous fabric and color and flow. got tons of compliments! very feminine and comfy. looks great with jeans and white crops.,1

1059,"These pants are cute. they seem, to me, to have a wider leg than appears on the model. they do run big, so i would recommend sizing down if in doubt. these are cute pants that can be dressed up or down, but unfortunately, look pretty sloppy by the end of the day, as they stretch and wrinkle very quickly. since they already run a bit big, this is a major negative. i wore them to church, and they were quite wrinkled by time i got home. by late afternoon, they looked like a different pair of pants.",1
916,I did not try this on alone but rather with a long sleeve white tee and white button down shirt. i really liked both looks. if i find it to be itchy like the other review i will have to return. this is an effortless fashion statement yet it could easily be a weekender cozy staple. my only complaint is why two neutral colors? this would have been great if offered in a richer darker yarn. the two offered colors are so similar and both looked drab against my skin tone.,1

872,"Lovely cut, pretty creamy color, great top for strong shoulders, however. the upper section of this top is way more sheer than it appears in the photos. there is no bra that would really work with it--unless you want to embrace the undergarment visibility and go with one that has really pretty straps. just be sure the bra fits especially well, because any back fat will absolutely show. if you go without a bra, though: headlights. so there's that.",0

865,"This is such a cute and flattering top. it isn't a style i would normally gravitate to, but i liked the color so i thought i'd try it on. i ended up trying on the medium because they were out of my usual large and it fits great. it drapes really nicely and looks super cute with jeans and booties. the little stripe of ladder lace around the middle is a bit see thru but not revealing. it's a nice top for transitioning from summer to fall.",1
866,"I love this top. it is loose and comfortable. it is not sheer so you don't need a cami. it runs a little large so size down if you want a more tailored fit. 1 criticism, it catches on sharp jewelry or belts and can pull if you are not careful.",1
282,"I love the way these shorts fit and look; very comfy, but after laundering one time, the lavender color became blotchy. used regular detergent in gentle cycle and it looks like someone poured bleach on them in random areas & they are unwearable! i have several colors, but the only color that was a problem is the lavender. $58 for one wear was a waste. i hate to leave negative feedback, but be careful with laundering.",0
895,"Although this is not my husband''s favorite (he prefers things a little more tailored). i absolutely adore this! i got this in the ivory/cream color not realizing they had it in two more colors. i just ordered the blue. i loved the way the size small fit (not as wide), but the medium for my height (5'7"") fit better and was longer. if i want to wear it as a dress, i could. i highly recommend this!! well made and looks great!!!",1
1077,"Love this dress and have bought the style in three color/pattern variations. fits comfortably, looks polished yet effortless. appreciate that the sleeves come closer to the elbow, gives it a vintage vibe.",1
1110,"I ordered the xxs p as this dress is not a fitted dress, and that was the right size for me. only thing is the length is a bit linger still 9lower on calf for me), the straps are almost tight, so i would say the dress is a reversed taper shape. color is beautiful, i ordered green as the other color (plum) doesn't have petite available. green is rich, and classy, the fabric is surprisingly soft. i love the little details in the velvet. definitely need a strapless bra for this one.

the blue color is much more of a dark teal, with more of a dull green tinge than i expected. still pretty, but definitely not a pure blue. i loved the look of the blue online, but i think the pink might have worked a little better with my coloring.

868,"The fabric is super soft and the grey is pretty, but it is light grey not dark grey as described when you select to buy it. my biggest issue with the top is that the cold shoulder arm reveals the entire arm, so if you aren't completely toned with your tricep and all over arm, it will show... which is why i bought this to hide my blunders",1

1086,This is definitely true to size. i tried both the small and medium on in the store and the small was too tight( this is meant to be a little looser like a tshirt) the medium was spot on. not too tight and not too baggy. i think it's a fun go to piece that can be worn with a jean jacket and sandels or booties. it looks like denim too which i wasn't expecting. way better in person!,1

1077,"This immediately caught my eye in the neutral pattern, and the fabric is actually quite nice. the fit is at least a size or two too large though, with the bust being way too large for me even sizing down. my normal 4 was big everywhere, and the 2 was still big in the chest, but fit everywhere else. the belt is handy for cinching in some of the loose areas, but the top section just didn't work for me. maybe better for someone better endowed?",0
825,"Love this button down, but i couldn't make it work. i'm 5'4"", 32b, and usually buy tops in a regular xs or s. i bought this top in a small and it was loose fitting which i liked, but too long for me causing the pleats to flare out more than i liked. the shirt is also pretty sheer, wear a skin colored bra unless you want it noticed. the material was soft and looked like good quality.",1

861,"I purchased this in the yellow for my daughter and she has not seen it yet. the style is very cute, but the fabric is quite thin. she will have to make that call, but if i had bought it for myself, it would be going back. i'm not willing to wear a camisole under a t-shirt. it also feels like the kind of knit fabric that shrinks and skews when it's washed, so that remains to be seen.",0

880,"This top is gorgeous in person, but when i tried it on, i fell out of love. it didn't happen immediately, but the more i wore it around the fitting room area, the less i appreciated its beauty. i tried it on in an xs - i typically wear a s or xs in most retailer tops - 5'8"", 140 lbs for reference. this top is just huge in the body! the fit is very boxy and just not flattering. yes, it could be cute with skinny jeans and perfect for preggo's! this was just a miss for me.",0
586,"I love the material on these shorts. unfortunately, that's all i love. the fit is awkward and i'm an easy fit. they're boxy in the body / legs and a bit tight in the waist, causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well. sadly, couldn't keep these just for the pretty fabric.",0
1078,"This is definitely a personal preference review. i loved this dress when i tried it on. it's really beautiful. however, there was just way too much fabric on the sleeves for me. i know it's the style and i have similar style dresses, but i felt really large in this dress and it all came down to the sleeves for me.",0
1078,Great dress that can be casual or dressy. well-made and comes with.a built-in slip.,1
863,"This tee is cute, keep in mind the white is totally sheer. but it's huge. i ordered an xxs and it's very loose and drapey, which is likely the style but when did sizing get to unrealistic? also, a totally sheer, basically a sort of fancier cotton tee for $60? no way.",0
941,"Loved the sweater and the sale price was great, but i could not take the shedding! even after just trying it on the first time, my jeans and top had shedding all over them. this was 2 minutes, i could not imagine what i would look like if i wore it all day. had to return.",0

1080,"I adore this maxi! the fit, style, pattern (black motif), machine washability, everything! fits tts (got my usual size s for 5'7"", 125lbs). i would say that the length is appropriate - some are super long on me, and i'm not one to wear heels. i was also happy that the top fits nice and snug - my issue is usually that when i bend forward the top drapes open due to my small chest - no problem with this dress! i think it's perfect piece for spring/summer/fall and dressing up or down. my one slight",1

376,"I saw this in my local retailer, and was blown away by how soft it was! the minute i tried it on, i didn't want to take it off. for being a boxy cut, it was surprisingly flattering. i have a large chest and normally wear an xl in retailer clothes, but i could easily zip the size large all the way up. this is the perfect hoodie to wear running errands on the weekend, or with a pretty blouse on under it at work. i know i'll get a ton of use out of it, so i recommend it!",1
866,"This tank (in black) is nice quality, most of the fringe hangs straight and seems to be attached well. it's just too short and too boxy for my figure (curvy/hips). would look good on someone who has straight hips and is not long waisted. since that doesn't describe me, it has to go back.",0
1094,Super cute dress but the waist band is very large and bulky.,0
1072,"This dress is beautiful and would make an excellent party dress for winter. it is well made and the details are pretty. however the waist is cut in sort of a scallop shape, so it is higher on the sizes and dips down in the middle over the stomach. i wear a size l or 10 in dresses at retailer, and it just did not flatter my body type at all. for a thinner, narrow silhouette, i suppose it would look better, like it does on the model. i had to return it.",0

829,"I bought this tunic today because it paired well with patterned slim pants. at 5'2"" the tunic felt like it added height and even though i'm a 34f the top fit well across the bust. i tried on the large first, and it felt very comfortable but a bit big. the medium fit a little more snugly, but was more proportional in the arms, so i purchased it instead.

835,I really wanted to love this top the material and pattern are lovely but the fit is strange. it looks like a maternity top on me and as another reviewer said it is right across the back but loose at arms and midsection. for the price i returned it.,0
116,Much lower quality than other robes i have purchased,0
1055,"These culottes are adorable on....if you order up two whole sizes! they run extremely small. fabric is thick, high quality and a beautiful color.",1
1095,This dress looks amazing on. it fits your body like a glove and the zipper lies flat. the black out-lined neckline looks very sophisticated as does the pattern of the dress. my only issue is that the dress ran very small.,1
1008,"I have an hourglass shape, so this skirt is winner for me. classic a-line fit but with a modern hem. it's subtly shiny, very stylish, and comfortable. paired with a tight shirt and heels it looks extremely sexy. a sale price makes it all the sweeter.",1
803,"Okay, this is the cutest sleep jumper i've ever owned. it's soft and cozy, and even a tiny bit sexy. i give it 4 stars because it's a little on the thin side; not sheer but close. really fun little piece. definitely recommend.",1

844,"I wanted to love this product so badly. i ordered it in the mail, and it looked beautiful coming out of the box. i normally look really nice in grey, but this color really washed me out and was not nice on. the fabric is very sheer, so you would have to wear it over a camisole/tank top. this is one of those pieces that looks better on the hanger than in person. large in arms, small on body. odd fit.",0
862,"I am 5' 7"" with an athletic build (small chest, small waist, muscular hips/thighs). this shirt just hangs on me and makes me look much larger than i am. i purchased a small, an extra small would be way too short. i could see how it works for fuller figured girls.",0
829,"I ordered this top on a whim and never in a million years did i expect to love it as much as i did. while it is by no means work appropriate, it is a fun top for a night out. the material is light and flowy and it drapes perfectly over my post baby tummy. i tried it on with jeans, shorts and white pants and it really looked great with all items. wish this came in a few other colors. for reference, i am a 36dd and a size 12, took the large and it looked flowy without being maternity topish.",1
1110,"I wanted this immediately after seeing it in the catalog. i couldn't wait for it to get to my store so i ordered it and it did not disappoint! it is extremely flattering on my hourglass figure. the pattern and colors are amazing. the unlined lower half does not bother me. i will be wearing this with a denim jacket, light sweater, wedges, then booties in the fall! i fell like this dress will be able to be worn for years to come.",1
995,"This is an interesting skirt. the fabric is comfortable, breathable and flowy. it is eye-catching. but the pattern is not one i would say i love, although i do like it. the lighter color in the pattern is more pink than off-white, which is fine, but that did surprise me a little. overall, i kept it for comfort and because i liked it enough for the sale price i paid for it.",1
1080,"Not in love with this one. the fabric is thin and seems cheap... it seems overpriced even on sale. and it runs a bit small along the bust. i could maybe get away with it without a bra, but after 3 kids, braless isn't my best look. and i don't think the print is a pretty in person as it is online - can't quite put my finger on why... maybe a little darker in person. that said, the fit is flattering. the cinched waist is lovely, and the skirt is nice and flowy. even so, this one is going back.",0
828,This shirt is like the best worn in flannel with a little feminine flair! super soft and great length.,0
1131,"I was so excited for this coat when i saw it in the catalog, but disappointed when it got to stores. the faux fur pictured both here and in the catalog looked much more of a burnt red brown color than the straight up maroon that it actually is in store. i'd say it even looks a bit purple. the nice thing is that it is detachable and you can replace it with something else if you really don't like the color. i have decided to buy it anyways because the fit of the coat is lovely and simply stunning.",1
829,"I love tunics and the colors of this one is what caught my eye. overall, the tunic is nice but i have to agree with another review that the stitching at the top of the slits is not good. i also agree that the slits are to high. they should have made them stop at a lower point. it gives an odd effect. the tunic looks good especially with tights. it is tts and i believe the top probably looks better on someone tall because the length of it is so long compared to other tunics.",1
862,"Super soft and colors are great. i got the navy and plan to wear with white jeans and platforms, similar to the photo. would also look great with black skinny pants. worth it for the sale price.",1
766,I'd hoped these would be cozy and warm. the fabric is thin and slinky. it grabs and emphasizes every bump and roll. couldn't wait to get them off. just horrible. and that price is very steep. can't recommend.,0
817,It broke my heart to return this shirt. the pattern is just the kind of quirky that i crave from retailer. the quality is really great but in the end this shirt was just way to big. i don't think the xs would have made enough of a difference. sad face.,0
960,Really great best.  nice substantial material and great fit.  will be able to wear with many things.,1
870,"Thought this would be my goto fall ""dressy sweathsirt."" it ran smaller than expected and it just didn't have the drapey sweatshirt shape that i prefer. the detailing on the arms and waistband is to die for though.....",0
1082,"Just piping in here -- ordered my usual size of small petite. the slip that came with the dress is about a size negative zero, it could hardly squeeze over my body and the dress itself is a bright pale aqua and it is a shift. and because of the smocking it hangs very strangely. i think it looks very cheap and is ill fitting. i would say if you are a person on which shift dresses look awesome you might like this, but mind the size of the slip in the petites range, and also it is aqua.",0

959,"This jacket is a great fit and feels like a nice, comfortable addition to a professional/work wardrobe. it is very lightweight and fits somewhat loosely. i am 5""7 and 125 lbs and the small fits nicely. the only con is that there is not a way to secure down the top payer of the wrap )no snap, button, etc.).",1

1058,"First, let me say i really like these pants before i get into what's wrong with them. the fabric is a nice weight and drapes really pretty. they are very long for you leggy girls out there or ladies who like to wear platform shoes and that's a plus for me.

now for the issues: the waist runs small, but not so much that i can't wear them. they are roomy and comfy otherwise, just snug there. the hem came out of mine, so that's the big bummer here. i have to hem them, which is a chore and i wish th",1
1095,This dress needs such a specific body type but that's not to say it isn't for everyone. this dress is lovely but it's a dress that you need to try on in multiple sizes to figure out which will fit. i tried this in three different sizes to find the fit it was supposed to be. i had to size up and go to petite size. i do vary between 6 and 8 and this one i ended up getting an 8p. this dress is lovely but it is a trial and error dress so don't get discouraged if you have to size up it will look love,1

i got the lavender - looks exactly like the pic. and it is true to size.",1

821,A great addition to any wardrobe. can go with nice trousers and dressier shoes for work or jeans and trainers for a casual look. i didn't find it to run small and indeed thought it fit as i'd expect.,1
931,"This is an absolutely gorgeous sweater. the colors are just as they appear online, but the length stated for the petite version is way off. i suspected as much from the picture, but decided to try it anyway. the petite small went down to my ankles! too bad. i would have loved this sweater if it were an above-the-knee or even at-knee length.",0
927,"Also, does run big, though i felt te xs seemed fine (usual size is xs). passed as there were better options, runs big,but mostly, it was scratchy. beautiful color and design, however.",0
873,"I bought this in xl and it fits just as shown. i could size down to a l and it would still fit because there is a lot of flow to this top. so, if you want a more tailored, but loose fit, then size down.

 but, it isn't boxy. and, the deep v is sexy, but not immodest. and the pocket looks like silk, but it's just polyester. the pleating in the back gives this movement or move-ability, like when you drive. there isn't much pull. 

it's a thin light material and very cool for hot, humid summer",1
1078,"I was so excited when this dress arrived today. as other reviewers have mentioned, the fabric is lovely, soft and drapey and it feels great on. it felt great, that is, until i looked in the mirror. while the dress fit fine, i have a large bust, and the fabric stretched across the bust, causing the print to appear washed out across the bust. not a good look. sigh. another return.",0
850,"This is such a cute design, but it's so short! it barely hits at my hips. you'd have to wear a layer under it to keep your tummy from being exposed. i'm also not thrilled with the buttons - i am a 34c bra size and the second button was gaping open on the size 4 top. i wish they'd been sewn shut - the neckline is so big, it's not like the buttons need to function. i got the burgundy with pink flowers and the colors are great. too bad it's so short and gapes open at the bust. going back.",0
1098,"Now that i have this dress in my life i think my wardrobe is done.  there is nothing but love for this dress as it hits all the correct points:  great fit, flattering silhouette, comfortable fabric, shape enhancing cut, and the easiest casual style ever!  i got the 10p and my body is 5'3"" 140# 36dd",1
1059,Fit great. hang nice. extra loop to hold belt. perfect design.,1
831,I purchased the teal/blue and the color is striking. though i put true to size the decorative top is slightly tight around the bust. and the bottom too is fitted and not flowy. for a looser fit you may want to size up. for a more fitted look it is true to size.,1
862,The print doesn't necessarily works for everybody.,0
826,"My review of the pros : 1) quality made, not see through in any way, can wear with small bra straps 2) lace gives the top a 'different look"", really liked it. my review of the cons, which made me return the top 1) runs huge!!! i am 5'2"", 36 small c, broad shoulders and my usual size medium looked like an xl. it was large in the bust area and almost 'puckered' at the armpits? i would probably order 2 sizes down to an xs, which i never wear in any size top. 2) for petite gals (i am 5'2""), this a a",1
567,"This is a beautiful spring/summer dress, and the quality of the materials is great. i wanted to love it. but the sizing is ridiculous! i'm 5'3"" and 115 and i think you could fit three of me comfortably in the xs. while the pictures of the model in the dress don't suggest it has a shapeless cut, it definitely looked like a sack on me. a sack with a lovely print, but still an ill-fitting sack.",0

1022,"I have a few pairs of the stevie ankle, so i thought i try these. they have very little stretch and feel tight in the waist. the distressing near the front pockets is really apparent...like white stripes. they make the jean look overall cheap. not worth $198, in my opinion.",0
242,"Holy cow does this run small-like really small. i ordered the normal size i would wear and couldn't even get it passed my legs-until i supplied the most amount of effort i could (against my better judgment) and managed to get it on-but it was definitely too small. i would classify myself as petite and my normal size was way too short on my torso. it, of course, was a mistake to force it on because it was just as hard to get it off.

831,I loved this blouse when i got it and wore it before washing. it fit really well and was flattering. the only time i laundered it i hand- washed it in cold water and hung it to dry. the blouse shrunk at least a full size and in awkward places. the sleeves are now tight and way too short. the overall length shortened by at least 2 inches. the top is so tight in the bust now that the buttons popped open. i'm very disappointed and surprised.i will be returning it as it is unwearable as is.,0

316,I am so sad that this romper didn't work out. it's just way too billowy and huge. i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small. i'm petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper! might look best on taller girls. i am 5 '2 and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent. do not recommend. such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews!,0
862,"I was so excited to find this shirt on sale at my local retailer store. but, i did not notice the high percentage of rayon in the fabric, which caused the shirt to shrink significantly in the wash (even when following washing instructions). i washed it on cold with woolite and it is about half the length it was initially! i'm so disappointed. how can you make a shirt that can't withstand washing?!",0

96,This could have been an amazing chemise but it is too short even for bed- perhaps it could be used for a tank. i am 5'3 but do have a long torso. it did not fully cover my booty.,0
840,"Wow this is huge! i'm all for the tent-look with the right style, but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width, and with the peplum style, extra width doesn't flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it doesn't hang nicely, it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top, then this is perfect, but if you wanted something that hangs nicely, look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s, my typical size.",0
862,"This tank is an easy piece to add into your summer wardrobe and its amazingly affordable. i don't think the material is too think like the previous reviewer. i chose the petite size and it sits well at the chest and is a great length. not too long, but still able to front tuck. i bought two colors and am interested in all the rest!",1

super bummed and now there's no way to replace it. wamp wamp.",1
868,Do not buy! i used my 15% discount on this. what a waste. my usual sizes range from s to l depending on what brand. i should have gotten a small. i don't think that would've helped. it was so awkward looking. nothing like the model. it made me look as if i had gained 15 pounds. it was waaay longer in the back-like a mullet. the material was really thick. it is more appropriate for fall. i had high hopes for this-to dress up or down. it was just so ridiculous.,0

1082,"This dress is so different from any you normally see and its gorgeous. the blue on bottom is actually a much brighter blue in person than in the pictures on the site. the dress pleats along every blue line, so when you walk, it's as if the dress changes colors with every movement. it's fully lined so nothing shows underneath and it's just really beautiful. i also like how the back opens, but not all the way down, so you can wear a strapless bra without the back showing. 
but the sizing was a bi",1
831,I agree with the other reviewer that the color of this top is more burgundy with purple undertones rather than a deep red like shown online. the fit was very boxy on me and it did not look flattering. i was not willing to to have it altered so i returned it.,0

1083,This dress is stunning! the quality is impeccable and the craftsmanship is stunning. i ordered my typical size and it was snug but sizing up would not have worked. this may be the most beautiful high quality piece i've ever seen at retailer!,1

619,I can't believe how small these are. i almost wondered if the size was marked incorrectly. these are so pretty and such a shame because i love them. the rise in the crotch is also very short. very full in the legs and one is longer than the other:( the stripes don't line up in places which is also disappointing for this price!,0
1056,"Love these chinos! they are so soft, have the right amount of stretch for a curvy figure, and the colors are great. i have purchased the khaki and blue so far. the blue color has the perfect washed/faded look. i love that they have petite sizes available. i will be stocking up on the other colors.",1
839,This is a nice tunic but i wish it was a bit more structured. the band in the back helps hold it together so it doesn't balloon out but a few more pin tucks would have been nice. i do like the length and style as a alternate to a white button down shirt and it looks super cute with skinny crop pants.,1
1099,So i notice most ladies on retailer love to say how tiny they are. so some of us that are busty and have a hip--this is nice. i actually could've done a medium but the large was the only one and on sale. it's meant to be loose! it's kind to ladies that aren't all size 2 :),1
1042,"I really wanted to love this, but it was just too voluminous to be flattering. i am typically a size 10 or 12 in dresses and jumpsuits, and the medium was billowing around me. also,the elastic waist hit me low and bunched in an unflattering way. it had to go back.",0

861,"This is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer, but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear. this brand makes some of the softest, cutest tees, but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry. not worth the cost.",0

833,I bought this today in a size 2. fits perfect. i am normally a 0 or 2 or xs. the top looks and fits exactly like the picture if you are small chested. because it is not long in the front. i think if you are larger chested the top will stick out too much and be too short in front. it is not super voluminous in front which is a good thing. it does have the volume in the back which gives it a cute shape. it is on the shorter side. very nice material and design as well as details. overall good pick.,1

1030,"Oh wow no.
as the previous reviewer said, much lighter than the picture!
rise and inseam are as described but with the light denim they combined to make a bad look for this 40something. maybe for a younger audience who like the 90s retro vibe?
the fit is true to size, i tried the 27 and it was a nice snug fit around the bum (waist 28/29, hips 36, usually a 27 or 28 in jeans, sometimes even a 29 if they're super skinny).",0
13,"I love the color, the fabric and the style (especially in the model shots) but in reality, the cut is disproportionate. the hips and hip pockets flare out creating a saddlebag look. it is not smooth and fitted as shown on the model. overall you need to size down since i could pullover the dress without unzipping. i think the felted boiled wool is great quality but a tiny bit itchy. i still recommend the dress because i will be wearing it with a long sweater coat which will hide the weird hip act",1
1024,"These are worth the money! gorgeous fit, soft denim, and make my body look long and sleek (especially my bottom). i wear mine w a white tee underneath and plan to add booties for the fall but for now, platform clogs. fabulous.",1

988,This skirt for sure was the most disappointing thing i've ever ordered from retailer. it looks like an all white skirt that has a little stiffness to it but looks are deceiving. it has this weird checkered patten and there is no shape to the skirt at all. there are also weird stitching lines. one more thing that i didn't like about the skirt was that it's a cream-ish color. not even the cute flamingos will make me keep this skirt. it's going back.,0
828,"Loved everything about this top except two things: the price (there is a lot of pretty detail though) and the shoulders. what is not depicted in the stock photos is how wide the shoulder ruffles are...i have an athletic build at 5'7"", 140 lbs and 32dd and this top unfortunately made me look like a football player. i ordered a small and the fit was perfect. beware that this top is on the shorter side. it really is very pretty but i would steer away if you have athletic or broad shoulders.",0
368,"I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay, but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store, i would have passed over it. however, i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies, though!",0
835,"I really liked this top, but it was very expensive even when on sale, and it ended up being boxy. i am flat-chested (32a), 5'7'. if i remember correctly, i tried on the xs. it was cute, but it wasn't flattering because it was so boxy on my frame. perhaps it'd be more flattering on other body shapes. i think it would be cuter if it was a bit more fitted. otherwise, the quality seemed great, though i'd be worried about all the beading falling off eventually.",1
1081,I purchased this dress for my graduation. the colors are much more intense and bright then they appear online. i'm kind of concerned that i look like a carnival tent. i like the style but the fabric feels cheap for the cost of the dress. the fabric is 100% synthetic.the fit is great. the dress is true to size,0
828,Beautiful pattern and shape! however i had to send it back! it is extremely see through and ran very small! i even sized up and it still pulled in the bust area! maybe someone with a smaller bust might fit them better!,0
829,"I was struggling with the options above-- does it fit true to size or is it too small or too large? it is both too small and too large, which is really strange. the model makes this shirt look stunning, but the product is actually very boxy. i am 5' 3"", weigh 112 lbs and i typically order anywhere from a 00p-0r/xxs-xs. i ordered this shirt in an xsp and the shirt sleeves were short and the middle was boxy. quite frankly, it looked like a maternity shirt and the structure was not worth the money",0
863,"The knit is thin.  it's more for a chilly spring or warm fall day.  but, it's not see-through, although a bit light weight.

the style if figure-flattering and fits tts.  i am short and i found the sleeves, length perfect.  so if you are tall, you ""might"" find this shorter in the arms or body on you.

i bought the purple and it's a great color.  love it!",1
778,Love these - the colors are perfect for fall. originally ordered a small which fit fine (i'm a 6-8) but felt the black color would look better if i sized up and the material wasn't as stretched - i'm glad i exchanged for a medium for that reason.,1
1092,"The first reviewer said it was small in the bust, but the 0p i ordered fit everywhere, rib cage and all, but was gaping at the bust (in the back). i would say overall it was true to size but if i sized down, it would be too snug in the rib cage. i am 30dd for reference there and waist is 26.5 inches,

otherwise, the make is very pretty, i like the texture in the fabric, the color is very pretty as well. embroidery seemed high quality, but i decided to pass on it, even on sale, since it didn't",1
1078,"I really, really wanted to love this dress. the v-neck plunge is way too deep. i needed to pin it to keep it closed. the blue color was pretty, and the front was flattering, but the back was not. it was super clingy in the back and didn't hang in a flattering way. sadly, i sent it back.",0
811,This is baby soft and a great basic. i ordered my normal size large and it clings in an unattractive way so you might want to size up for a better fit if you're not going to wear it as a layer. the black color is saturated in a good way. it's also very long but i'm short so this would be perfect for taller frames.,1
383,"Looked really cute on the hanger, so i took it with me into the dressing room. the fabric is super soft, and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short! you can't tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg. the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think you'd most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer. i wish i could pull this off...maybe i'm just too old for it.",0
986,"I generally don't write bad reviews, but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost. the design and colors are great, but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer's tag is at the back of the neck. the material is very thin, so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment. i shop at retailer all the time, and this is not a $98 item of clothing.",0
1086,The style was really cute but the fit was huge. i ordered an xs. i don't think going to the xxs would have helped. i ended up returning it.,0
974,"I ordered two of these, the grey and ivory. i have had great luck with jackets and blazers from retailer. these were the exception. i just could not pull them off. the quality was great but they had little shape except being a bit boxy. i do have wider hips. maybe these would look better on someone tall and thin? for reference, i am 5'6 and about 138lbs. i ordered smalls and the sizing was perfect for me, the style was just off. i had to return both.",0
1065,"Thick material and cute design. i am typically a size 2 and the small in this fit but was snug in the crotch and just zipped at the waist there is not much if any stretch. i am 5'6"" with a 26 1/2 in waist so that was unexpected. it does have cinchers at the waits but they are more for aesthetics than functionality. it is a very cute design and the fabric is nice as well as the direction of the stripes.",1

the 'green' is definitely more brown.",1
829,"I love this shirt, very comfortable and has a nice drape. i originally bought the size i normally wear but found it to be a little tight across my chest, so i returned for the next size up.

very well made and not sheer so did not have to wear a tank underneath.",1
129,"I got some nice things for christmas but this (along with the matching leggings) was hands down my absolute favorite gift! so stylish, so cozy, the perfect length to cover your bottom, the perfect fit (38dd and ordered an xl), love the pockets, i could go on and on. the perfect set to lounge around the house in. sleeves are a bit long so i had to fold them. when i say it is ""the perfect fit"" it is oversized (not huge) but it is roomy and that's how i like it as loungewear.",1
1078,"To my knowledge this dress looks great on everyone. the fabric is light and of moderate quality, the finishing is acceptable. a great basic.",1

1072,"I love love love this print and had to have it when retailer had their 25% off sale. i think regular price is way too much for this dress as the dress isn't even silk or a better material. but once i got this i was so disappointed, i ordered my usual size and it was just a balloon/tent on me. i felt like i was wearing a maternity dress. plus the ruffle at the top which i thought was a sweet feature felt really awkward and like it was grazing my neck and chin in an annoying way. i don't even want t",0
881,"I was so excited to wear this shirt, even after reading the review that it curls up i decided to give this shirt a shot, and i found that the same thing happened to me. it also clings tightly to the body. i would not recommend this shirt for anyone with broad shoulders.",0

1081,"I bought this on sale thinking it was a great deal, but when it came in i found it to fit like a totally unflattering sack. the pattern didn't help anything, looking totally faded and washed out...the fabric and overall quality is nice, but the fit and pattern are just so..ugly, unfortunately. had to return it.",0

1078,"Ordered this in the neutral motif, size large and it's a great little dress. comfortable and cute, but modest enough that i'm not worried about my bust (38d) hanging out too much. the v-neck hits at the perfect spot. the sleeves are the perfect 3/4 length, not too tight and it's not too short on me (5'9""). i'm a light blonde and i don't feel washed out in this. it hides a little belly well without being a tent. also, the lining is super soft and flexible. the only problem is the upper back falls",1
1079,"This dress is adorable and well made. this brand runs on the large side. i ordered an xs and the tag says 'p"" on it. it's not petite. it ran large through the hips and will need alteration. i'm keeping it because it is really cute and is well made. the material is knit and soft - very comfortable. i'm surprised nobody has reviewed this item. i probably will not buy this brand again only because it runs large.",1

1081,"Do not buy this dress for full price. the design looks great but after receiving the dress, the material is made of extremely cheap slinky-ish polyester that you would find at a f21 store. the stitching is horrific and created an uneven ""hump"" on the back seam. just absolutely poor poor quality.",0

862,I love this top! i think the knit rib quality is quite lovely and the color is gorgeous. i bought the plum color and got many compliments while wearing it. i like that it's a little on the longer side. i wore it with my pull-on ponte pants and booties. very cute!!,1

937,"The image online doesn't depict this blouse well.. my complaint is that the sweater portion looks crooked and shrunken where it has been cut at waist level and the ruffles have been attached at the hips. maybe i received a flawed piece, either way, i'll be sending it in for return.",0
1022,"I've been buying stevie ankles for years from retailer and been very happy. the past two pairs i bought had a heavy chemical smell, which i imagine is some kind of starch/chemical to keep the denim stiff. with the first pair, after enough washes to get rid of the bad smell (4), they lost all form and looked terrible since they were washed i couldn't return them. the 2nd pair arrived with the same heavy smell and i returned them. it may be they are made elsewhere now, but it's disappointing.",0

871,"This top has a nice design. i love the lace up back which makes it much more adjustable in shape. if you lace it lower it is more flattering to your waist. however the fabric quality is very poor on the white tank. it arrived with a small tear in the front hem area, which i could have easily fixed. it is very sheer; even with a nude bra, my bra was too visible for my comfort. plan on wearing a full camisole underneath, tank, or bralette you are fine with being on display.",0

needs very little by way of accessories because the lace edging is so beautiful.4 seasons appropriate!",1
907,"This sweater looked so promising with the tie waist and pretty lacy edging, but turned out to be a disappointment. it was much shorter than it looks in the photos and barely came to my hips. and the plum color was much darker than i expected, more of a dull brownish-burgundy.",0

1098,This dress was sooo cute online and in the store - i hands down would have bought it but i had an extra few minutes so i decided to try it on- terrible! the dress looked awakward on me- the strings lacing strings had town on a few spots and it just was not flattering for a curvy girl. now i know why there were so many in the store! which is a rarity for my location.,0

860,I was taking my time with this purchase i needed a top for a pair of ombrã© silk pants that i had tailored to fit. but everytime i put these pants on i couldn't find any top to come close to match..especially since the pants are for a more sophisticated look. well this top fits that perfectly and i'm excited to pair them for a nice dinner out. plus i was equally excited when i could pair the top with my jeans and sandals.,1

1088,Bought the dress online and it only has an eye and hook at the top. the waist has no stretch and their isn't a zipper. you have to be a contortionist to get it over your head and shoulders. so cute in the pic but not realistic. going back.,0
1078,This was just not flattering for me--looked too much like a maternity dress. i can't really do a belted waist so perhaps that would make this dress more versatile for someone else. i was sorry to have to return because it goes well with sandals and boots!,0
1025,"True to the verdugo style. love the fit, stretch but holds shape...super comfy!",1

so disappointing - i want my $180 back!",0

166,"I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body, but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.",0
907,"This is a beautiful sweater and a nice medium weight. however, it is an awkward length. i am tall and have a long torso so it's just not cut right for me and was not flattering.",0
1104,I purchased this dress because i have a similar one with a linen skirt from the spring. the skirt on this dress is a heavier fabric and it lays very nicely. the top provides good coverage for my larger chest and i took my typical xs size. i would definitely recommend this purchase.,1
1021,"This skirt looks and feels cheap, and the color is much more green than pictured. additionally, i comfortably wore a size 4 and then lost a few pounds, and this is still way too tight to be flattering.",0
1075,It's okay for a coverup or beach dress and lounging around the house. it's comfy and i like the detail of the back. the front is very plain but okay. it's not too baggy and it's a straight cut. the detail in the back makes it a keeper for me but only as a casual dress too chill at home or quick errands to grocery store.,1
1123,"Almost perfect! this jacket doesn't have that weird vegan smell. it's soft, smooth, and very high quality. this jacket is also a nice surprise for us busty ladies. i'm a 32ddd and the m fit nicely, no squishing (as the other reviewers have said, the chest has room!). 

i got the gray, and i loved it it's soft tint. i returned it because the lower band of the jacket sits right at my widest part of my torso, my post-baby belly. the jacket is sort of short like a peplum, and i want to hide the st",1
1086,Absolutely amazing! a must staple in every one's closet this season. i purchased the dress in a medium for a more relaxed look/feel. the silhouette is comfortable and makes for the perfect put on,1

864,"I bought this online to wear in my engagement photos, and its absolutely perfect! i typically wear a size l or xl and could have easily worn the l in this top, runs a tad big. keep in mind it is on the shorter side. i will be purchasing a white tank to wear underneath it.",1
1079,I really wanted to love this dress but it was not right for me.   made my curvy body look shapeless.  also had a button crack before i even put it on.  returned it.,0
824,Definitely was disappointed in the fit of this potentially very cute shirt. just too large; too much fabric for me. i'm usually an xs and there was just no shape to that size for my small bod. i wouldn't have minded the longer length if there had been a better fit up top. i think the colors are also a bit duller in person. love the concept though!,0
1081,I have this in black and red. it's a great and flattering dress that is a worn a bit large. you can wear it out on a date or more casual. the fabric is super comfortable as well.,1
880,"This skirt runs very large--even in the petite line. there was also no shape to the skirt (at least as it looked on my body). the color was nice (in the pink-grapeish hue), but ultimately the skirt just looked like a tent on my body (00p).",0

1083,"This was was a great buy! i got in on sale and the quality is really excellent. the material is thick and stretchy. there is a spanx like liner which is really nice as well for smoothing out the bumps. the dress style and cut is very slimming. i am more a size 14 (at 5'10"") and the 12 fit well. i agree with the other reviewer regarding the twisted shoulder. it doesn't lay on me either like it does on the model, but it doesn't detract from the dress so its a keeper given the other positives.",1
1086,"I love cloth and stone and the softness and prettiness of this fabric did not disappoint. this is not a dress, however. it is a long shirt. the sides were so short the you could see where my bum and hamstrings came together. leggings would ruin the look and as a shirt it would be totally impractical. for reference i am 5'8"" and 130 lbs. the small was the correct size, save for the length.",0
860,"I wanted to like this top so so so so badly. so badly in fact, that after the first size didn't fit, i ordered two other sizes to make sure: xl, l, m. none of them worked i really wanted to like this top. the online photo makes the clothing look so flattering and the shirt is just not....at least on me. the shirt online on the model looks slimming and a lot longer than the actual piece of the clothing. the beaded work is very beautiful, but short causing the very poofy peplum to start at the mos",0
1083,"I love this dress. it's adorable and great for summer with a unique style- it's a bit unusual with the high and slightly ruffled neck. it can easily be dressed up or worn more casually. this is the most flattering dress i've found this season (particularly around the stomach area). i'm 5""3' and took a petite size, which fit perfectly. this dress is a bit translucent, so skin-toned undergarments are a must.",1
871,"This top has a nice design. i love the lace up back which makes it much more adjustable in shape. if you lace it lower it is more flattering to your waist. however the fabric quality is very poor on the white tank. it arrived with a small tear in the front hem area, which i could have easily fixed. it is very sheer; even with a nude bra, my bra was too visible for my comfort. plan on wearing a full camisole underneath, tank, or bralette you are fine with being on display.",0

1037,They are very comfortable and have kept their shape after a couple of wearings. the pants can be used for informal or on the dressier side. the spandex in them is contributes to the comfort.,1
868,"Purchased this should in the blue motif in size small. i am usually between a small and medium in shirts, 36c broad shoulders. the fit was fine in the small. however, i had a few issues with the top: 1) the blue motif looked actually like a faded blue (as if it had been washed quite a few times and looked worn), 2) the front mid/bottom section laid strangely and gave me a maternity look, and 3) the back has alot of fabric (see back of tank in white motif) and was very voluminous. for me, it wasn",0

1111,This dress is so beautiful in person! but the quality was very upsetting. i had two buttons come off before even putting it on. i was so excited to get his dress for my wedding shower and then i couldn't wear it :(,0
868,"I thought i would love this shirt because it goes along with my style, but i returned it immediately. it runs so large! the colors are faded, and the trim of the shirt curl over, so it looks cheap and frumpy. i do not recommend this! it hits in all the wrong places.",0
1098,"Regretfully, this dress is on its way back for an exchange. the dresss is beautiful and fits true to size, i ordered it in both colors, however, the black has a defect in the lace right on the front of the dress, and the white was tearing in a few spots under the arms and on the bottom. again, the dress is so pretty and i am hoping retailer will find me one without bunching, pulls , or tears for an exchange, but i can't pay 130"" for a dress that is already torn.",1
1080,"I love my new maxi dress! as soon as i put it on, i knew this dress would be my go to dress of the summer. i love the styling with the thicker shoulder straps and higher cleavage. you will definitely be able to wear a regular bra with this dress. the material is soft, light, and flows well. i particularly love the ruffle on the bottom of the dress - it adds that extra little feminine touch. i can't wait to wear it.",1

1078,"The colors and fabric on this dress are really pretty. the lace is a soft blue instead of white. i have other dresses like this from this brand and really wanted to keep it, but it runs larger than the others i have. also, it doesn't have pockets. if it fits you properly, i think you will love it!",1
860,"I bought this top to add some more color and pattern to my summer wardrobe. it is really cute and a flattering cut. i just had a baby, so it's perfect for showing some curves without clinging. if anything, i'd say it maximizes my bustline more than i expected, but is still very flattering. i think i'm still getting used to my new bustline ;) soft, comfy fabric. not too hot. i get compliments when i wear it!",1

1094,"The colors are vivid and perfectly autumnal but the fit is a mess. it was overall too large, the waistline curves up in the front and then falls into small pleats which was maternityish, the waistband was thicker than the dress and sat away from my body and the material was a cheapish poly. had the outer dress been made from the same material as the lining, i would have liked it better. the modesty closure was a plus but the dress was already unraveling when i took it out. #returned",0

1107,I wanted to love this dress but sadly returned it.  i think it would be more appropriate for someone younger.  it runs very large but its not clingy so forgiving of anyone with chunkiness (such as myself).  i guess i just thought the blue was a little too unexciting (for me).,1

697,"This is such a neat dress. the color is great and the fabric is super soft. i am tall so the long length was an added bonus. it definitely needs something underneath since the front gaps. i am going to pair it with a funky tank top, necklaces and boots. super cute!!",1

1082,I read the previous comments and was skeptical. i love the dress! it's fitted on the top and flowy on the bottom. i didn't find it too big or maternity on the bottom half. the print is really pretty with flecks of blue that brightened up the dress.,1

823,"I really love the colors of this top, especially in the pinky pastels. it fits really well, can be tied or untied, and will pair with just about anything from skinny jeans to pilcro shorts. speaking of that, i do recommend pairing it with skinny pants or crops because it does have that classic retailer ""am i hiding a pregnancy"" feel to it.

1020,"I really loved this skirt on the model. i ordered it in my typical 0 and it fit well. the green was adorable, and the buttons are rose gold, which is quite pretty. i did exchange this skirt for a 2, only because the 0 was just too short for me. if the 2 is a bit longer but not terribly huge in the waist, i will probably keep it. i was surprised by how large the a line felt, but i think i can get used to it. it really is very fun, and very easy to dress up or down. i'm really hoping the bigger si",1
520,I love this style of tank top with the wider straps. very flattering but yes the armholes are big and i noticed the sizing is different with each color. i normally wear an xs but in the gray and blue i bought s to have a little room. i also bought the black color but the s was huge! i exchanged for an xs so hopefully it will fit better. it had to be ordered. it definitely stretches out as you wear it though.,1
1091,"The dress is great for pear shapes. however, i do feel it runs larger than typical retailer sizing. ordered a small (5'8"" 140#) and i still think it may be a bit big. the material is very comfortable, not too thick or thin. however, i feel the shaping on the bottom is a little bulky due to the fabric. see the attached photo.",0
1094,"This is a really nice quality dress. it is a low-cut v-neck but the fabric is form fitting so its not revealing when u move. i love the top part of the dress but the skirt just did nothing for me. it's a soft material but the skirt almost resembles a bath towel in look and feel. i am petite in size (5'0"" 100lbs). i will be returning due to the skirt being to loose on me in width rather than length. also, the center pleat of the skirt makes it look a bit odd. the skirt hit right at knee height.",0
193,"I was so excited for this to come in the mail, once i got it and opened it up i actually went back to verify this was in fact pajamas! it is great quality and super soft! some positives were that it has pockets! (who knew?!) and like stated before it is super soft and comfortable. the only negative is that it is not physically attractive, it is very baggy and it a-lines out. it's fine its pajamas but if you are wanting something cute for bed and you have a straight body this may not be the answe",1
329,"I ordered this in xs, i'm 5'4"", around 115lbs, and it fits perfectly. the material is very soft, but not see-through, and the romper is well-made. i wish it came in other colours, i'd buy more!",1

i got this in the wine, which is a beautiful color. the design is nice and looks expensive (but i'm not sure how it will hold up after washing), it is oversized and a little boxy. i'm a medium or large on top and i ended up purchasing an xs and it fits just fine in the shoulders and arms. the rest of it is still roomy (though short) but perfectly fine. i got this on sale, so it was well worth the price point.",1

1096,This is a beautiful dress but unfortunately it is only for women who are not well endowed - it is extremely well fitted in the chest. the high waste also poufs out due to a lot of extra material and the double lining. a beautiful dress but a very very poor construction. also there are bright blue and yellow beads in the chest area that are a bizarre combo to the corals and browns of the fabric. i am normally a 4/6 at retailer and the 8 was extremely small.,0

1077,"I don't usually write reviews, but i loved this dress in the store and would have passed it right over online. the skirt is a charcoal color and the top is an antique white. it gives the appearance of a separate crop top. i would usually wear a small (5'2"" and 125 lbs.). i'm wearing a small in the photo, but ended up going back for an xs. the dress could go more casual with flats or boots and a scarf, or dressier with heels and jewelry. i think i'll get a lot of use out of it.",1
936,This sweater is very cute! it looks great with a blouse underneath and open the zipper or it is great with a camisole. you will need something underneath especially if the temperatures are low as it is a wee bit shear. i am a small/medium ordinarily but it depends upon the designer. this runs a little large but keep that in mind if you plan on layering. the price is right and the zipper is aesthetically pleasing. i have the blue and oatmeal/beige color both are great pieces to any wardrobe.,1

it is a full/ swing top, but the slightly shorter length balances out the fullness perfectly.

love both colors, and having fun wearing them.

861,I tried on about 25 items in the store today and didn't buy anything but if i had bought just one thing it would have been this great floral t-shirt (i may have to go back for it). the combination of the very soft material and faded look of the pattern gives it the look and feel of an old favorite tee shirt. the fit is exceptional as well- not too loose or too snug. i would definitely snap it up on sale and may even have to cave to the full price.,1

the caveat is that it wrinkles.. a lot.",1

1078,Just a heads up - this is a romper - pants and not a dress! you can't tell from the pictures. i ordered thinking it was a dress but it's actually ... culottes? i'm not sure what you would call it. the pull on styling was awkward and the sash was bulky. it definitely goes back!,0

1057,"I bought these immediately after trying them on. i was totally surprised to see these very cool, edgy pants at retailer. the color and details are spot on! great quality. i wore them with a blaclk leather high platform boot and black top tucked in. i received a lot of compliments. these look like they should come from europe! i just wish retailer would buy better quality and more interesting things like these pants.",1
993,Just didn't look as cute on me as the pics online. the color blocking was kind of odd actually. returning.,0
1110,"According to the label, this dress can be hand washed or dry cleaned. i hand washed and line dried per the instructions on the label, and all the seams have completely shrunk and gathered. it looks like there's a drawstring running through every seam. so disappointed in the quality and the labeling. awful! i gave it one extra star because it's cute.",0
1072,"This dress is really pretty, but the fit is off. it is not fitted at the waist which made the back look poofy. also, the arm length is not flattering; it needs to be either longer or shorter. additionally, if one was to wear it a lot, the felting might start to fray.",0
1096,"When i first put this dress on, i immediately thought...oh no, i can't pull this off. at least, not without a cow to milk. but this dress is so comfortable. the material feels divine and the quality really is excellent for the price. the pattern of the panel on the bodice creates a slimming effect so it is also very flattering if you can get the waist to hit right. (i had to try on a few different bras to make this happen.) fits true to size. i got a size 2 - my usual size and i have gained a fe",1
178,"I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes, the top and bottoms fit overall, but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work, which i am willing to work on s",0
1084,I was so excited to get this dress since it look so pretty on line but unfortunately the it was horrendous on. the model must have the dress tailored because it looks like a huge tent on me. it was very wide bust down and made me look 30 lbs heavier. i'm 5'4 and 125 lbs- ordered extra small and it fits bust up and arms so i say it's tts up top.,0
823,"I love this top! i ordered it in a medium, and it's perfect. i'm 47 years old, 5'2"", 125 lbs, for reference. the detail on this top is beautiful. can be paired with so many things. love it!!!",1
857,I've been searching for a brown top/dress/tunic forever and i finally found the perfect one!! i stumbled across this adorable tunic while browsing the clearance room at my local retailer and you can imagine my excitement when it was my size (small). i tried it on and almost asked to wear it out of the store. it's sooo soft and has a beautiful rib-like pattern/texture to it. you could wear it as a top with pants or a dress with tights/leggings.,1
1072,"This dress was pretty but had a weird fit. the waist droops down in the middle instead of going straight across, which i found unflattering. i ended up returning it.",0
1104,"If you're tall, this dress sits up too high-waisted and this makes your waist look big. it's also kind of thin material on top and stretchy, so even though i'm small chested it made my shoulders and chest look large, but not on a good way. in other words, this dress made me look fat. the length is not bad for taller gals. all in all, not worth it.",0
936,"I passed this sweater a few times during a recent visit to retailer. after striking out on several items i thought would work, i grabbed this sweater in the cream color. i loved it as soon as i put it on! it is meant to be oversized, which i love. the neck is chunky and looks good open or buttoned all the way to make a loose turtleneck. looks great with skinny jeans and booties. i went with my usual xs. great purchase!",1
829,"Love it! the light blue is a gorgeous color. i thought this might be more chambray, but i'm happy it's not. it's also stitched at the top so no awkward accidental peep show or need for annoying tape.",1
1103,"I so wanted to love this dress. i bought it in a size 4 and in both petite and regular, as i'm kind of in between and have a long torso and short legs. anyway, i'm 5'5"" tall and 130 lbs. the regular fit my torso well, and length not was too bad. with heals it might have worked without hemming. here is where it all fell apart. while understand that only really expensive designer clothing can afford to seam a pattern perfectly, i felt that the dot seam in the front of the dress was in a bad place.",0
921,"It is a beautiful sweater, but it is cropped and boxy.",0
828,"The sleeves were very tight in the upper arm area but the body was blousy, too blousy so to go up a size for the arms would mean it would be very oversized in the body. i like the fabric (nice and thick) but it did not work for me.",0
861,Love this soft sweatshirt. the peplum makes it a little different and the quality is great. go to piece for spring. loose fitting but true to size in shoulders.,1
1081,"I was thoroughly underwhelmed. it did not hang well, and the fit seemed off. the tie waist just sort of hung there. i could have sized down, but i didn't even want to bother. it was pretty boring and flimsy for $138.",0
1111,"I had high hopes for this dress but my husband said i looked pregnant and that i was wearing a tablecloth- and he was right! i'm usually a size 10 so perhaps this would look good on a talk lanky person with a very long torso... but probably not. way too much fabric around the midsection. it's a shame because the fabric was really pretty, but too stiff a hand to drape well.",0
921,"I so wanted to keep this, but the xs was even too big. i usually take an xs/s petite and thought i could get away with the xs of this. it is just too big. so sad to be returning it, wish it came in an xxs or petite.",1
820,"This tunic has nice, soft fabric and nicely done embroidery that make it stand out. it's comfortable and the fabric is very nice, but it is not flannel as advertised. the tunic is made out of a double-gauze cotton, which is a great fabric with a casual look.",1
886,I ordered the pink in size xl. the color was pretty. the problem is the material was too thin and tight. it ran at least a size smaller than shown in the photos online.,0
1107,"I ordered the red in xs petite, xxs and xxs petite (in case petite was too short). so far, the xs petite and xxs petite were shipped to me, however, thought the bag said petite, the actual dresses inside were regular sizes, and they were huge, even the xxs (i put it on on top of another knit dress and it was big0. so i reordered, this time only the xxs petite (though i am technically waiting for the xxs regular)... perhaps all the bags have been switched... we shall see, but perhaps this isn't t",1
1099,"I'm 5'2 around 125 lbs, muscular and petite, so i ordered a petite small and it fits great. the length is perfect, i can wear with heels or dress down with flops. it's lined, which i think most dresses and skirts should be, so i was happy about that. i was pleasantly surprised with the slits up both sides, to show a little leg....sexy. it's not too low cut that you have to wear a cami and ruin the neckline, so that's plus. my only issue was the fabric didn't line up on me the same as the model,",1
1094,"This dress is amazing! the fit, style, quality of fabric is just perfect. just the right amount of ""v"" in the front and back to be flattering and sexy without being too exposed! will be looking for more styles from this designer!",1
625,"This suit is super cute! i think it will be too short in the body for taller girls. i am 5'4 117 pounds 32c and bought the medium. very cute fit, but it's almost slightly too short in the body. maybe if you are smaller on top, you will get more length in the body? i really want to keep this suit. i might consider the large, but the rest of the suit fits perfect.",1

1095,"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 140 lbs and 38 (36d) - 32- 40. i'm normally a size 10 in most brands, and in maeve in the past. this dress was too tight across my waist and hips in a size 12, so it runs very slim.

2. this dress is very long waisted, so the top bunched up funny.

3. the horizontal bar in the back is in the wrong place, and will not hide your bra strap.

4. there are bra strap keep loops in the shoulders, but this is an off the shoulder top.

5. the underarms bunched funny.

6. the dress has h",0
1110,Construction excellent. the dress was pretty big around the hip...does not have a shape like seen in the picture. the fabric was beautiful but was stiff...like furniture. the color was not as vibrant as the picture. returned.,0
837,"Really wanted to like this and took chances based on other reviews, even with the sale price and addtl discount. it's basically $30 blouse fabric with design and detail-work of a much more expensive blouse. the white is sheer and and fabric will wrinkle easily. if it were black, you could probably get away with it, but the white shows too many flaws and will wrinkle. sad to have to send it back.",0
986,"A good part of my closet is filled with retailer clothes. i mix them with my basics, scarves and jewelry. so, i immediately thought of a dozen ways this kimono could jazz up anything from skinny jeans to slip dresses, even though i felt it was pretty pricey. when it arrived, i was more than disappointed in the cheapness of the fabric. it does nothing for any of my intended clothes, so it is going back asap.",0
1078,"Love this dress! i can't say enough about it. comfortable, stylish, packable! doesn't wrinkle at all. i love it. i bought the neutral and the turquoise. only planned on keeping one but i love it so much i'm keeping both. good dress for fall/winter to wear with flats or tights and boots. can easily be dressed up or worn casual. i am 5'1"" 115 lbs and bought the xs petite. perfect fit. a great price point especially with the 25% off dresses.",1
857,"I didn't realize the patterned material was tee shirt material. i got lots of compliments on it though. i'ts blowsey from the bust down (i got the short sleeved red one) but it's comfortable without looking sloppy. if you can pull off the tucked in look, it's super cute.",1
1099,"Wonderful and comfortable dress, very sweet.",1
875,I sized down from my typical size small. beautiful detail on the back. slightly sheer in front but dark bra or cami fixes that. shorter in front than back but not too short. goes with jeans and pants plus a shorter cardigan or denim jacket would look great.,1
1200,"Bought this dress without trying it on but listened to the previous reviews saying this ran small and wow does it. i usually wear a 6 but ordered an eight which was hard to get on even with the upsizing. i do have a 34ddd bust so i do have a difficult time when dresses have no stretch over give in that area. overall beautiful dress, fabric is not stretchy which killed it for me.",0
1092,"Despite the mixed reviews, i went ahead and bought this in my normal size. i am small-chested (34b) and found this to fit perfectly, so i understand why those with large chests were finding this impossible to fit at the top. the fabric and detail are stunning on this. there is not a lot of give to the fabric, but if you are smaller in the bust. buy it!",1
909,I love this pullover. i felt it was a little wide at the bottom but i received lots of compliments on it. i ordered a large because i did not want it tight around the bust (i wear a 36j bra) and biceps but i think i would have been fine in a medium.,1
1082,"I love my new dress! it is comfy, classy and so easy to wear! you can dress it up or down with ease. i'm looking forward to seeing more styles from this designer. i hope soon!! don't miss out on this dress. it's a must have for your wardrobe!",1
899,"The sweater material was really soft and seemed well-made. the back is an interesting twist, but the material creases easily; i can see it looking messy by the end of the day. the main reason i returned it though was because it runs very large. i got my usual s, and i could have sized down 1, maybe even 2 sizes. i didn't like it enough to try a smaller size.",0
862,"In a word .. clingy ... and not in good way. long so you need it to flow not cling. liked the back, but front was just too clingy. back it goes.",0
1056,"These are the most comfortable pants i have tried this season without sacrificing the style. they look best rolled up for that casual, chic look and can be dressed up or down. these do run slightly large. i'm 5""1 and 102- 104 pounds and took the 24 petite size. i bought the white color and will probably try another color or two before my size sells out. love these and really recommend them!",1
854,I just got this at the black friday sale..... i may have passed it by had i not been in an adventurous mood ( i usually wear brighter colors). it feels wonderful....cozy and silky like expensive pjs!! looks very glamorous yet laid back... i feel like i am in a 40's romantic film.. i got a ps and it fits flowy. it was the only one so i was not able to try the xs. love it! it was cold today so i wore a cami under it with lace peeking thru the low neckline .,1
860,"I tried this on (blue) in size 0 or xs (not sure how sizing was), regular size (sometimes i need petite). i don't think i need petite in this one though, i love the peek of lighter solid fabric on the hem, the whole tank is very soft. probably need a strapless bra to wear it, but could be paired with jeans for casual look or nice pants. pencil skirt for dressier look. i am 115 lbs and 30 dd for reference.",1
1125,"I bought a 2p when i should've bought a 0p. i was swimming in the 2p. however, it didn't matter, because everything was itchy, and i'm not even allergic to wool. the beautiful buttons are oddly placed to achieve that cool design, and just like other reviewers commented, you have to twist and contort them to get them to button...which, inevitably, will lead to them popping off. and i didn't see an extra one in case that happened. the coat is stunning, there's no argument about that, and i welcome",0
850,"I tried this blouse on in the store. i'm generally an 8 or 10 in this brand. i got down to a size 4 and gave up. this blouse is huge all the way around. the detail on the blouse is pretty, but the tent like cut made it impossible for me to buy it. i know retailers blouses can be swingy and flows but this went way beyond. perhaps on a tall person the swing would work but on a short person like myself...i looked ridiculous.",0
1024,The jeans are the perfect high-waisted jeans. they do not stretch out and fit perfectly. the perfect length for a heel. love them all year round.,1
830,"I tried on xs petites as someone had returned it . i didn't find that it ran small, it was ok on me. i am not sure if the regular size would work but i didn't end up purchasing this today as the color was jsut so-so on my skin tone.

likes: contrast and detail in ruffle, romantic

dislikes: the tag pulled on the fabric a bit and you could tell, so the fabric seemed fragile.",1
434,The blue was a great color and i like the idea of a reversible top. however the xs was just swimming on me. this looks much more fitted in the pictures. my favorite workout top is from this brand and it is fitted and held up for 6 months. where are the fitted tops?? i'll keep looking.,0
863,Great with leggings and skinny jeans! it's comfortable too!,1
1087,To be clear i am not built like your models but the biggest problem was the way in which it tented out from the bustline down,0
881,"I ordered this top because 1. the online product page states the fabric is cotton. 2. i liked the style with the scarf insets. 3. the colorful embroiderey would be a welcome companion for my many pairs of pilcro chinos.

size: i normally wear a small for most retailer brands, but i know nothing about slone rouge. i went with a small since it appears oversized on",0
854,"This top was fun. casual with flair. it is a little strange that it is see through down to the stomach almost, but i would just wear a bra of the same color and don't think anyone would notice.  i didn't buy because even the sale price is too much for a casual tee, in my opinion.",1
